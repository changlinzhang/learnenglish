very difficult to correct if you have been speaking English for a long time. As you know, practice does not make perfect, it makes permanent. That means if you practice incorrectly, it will become permanent. You need to correct this problem before moving forward because having bad pronunciation is one of the most difficult aspects of speaking to someone who does not speak English well.The pronunciation lessons provided here are American English pronunciation and will provide you with an explanation, instruction, and audio files to help you pronounce sounds correctly. If you don't have access to a native speaker to give you feedback, I encourage you to record and listen to yourself.

This is a very common question and it varies depending on your goal. Because TalkEnglish.com focuses on speaking, the vocabulary presented in this section will be the most commonly used words in speaking.There are roughly 100,000 word-families in the English language.A native English speaking person knows between 10,000 (uneducated) to 20,000 (educated) word families.Professor Paul Nation found that a person needs to know 8,000-9,000 word families to enjoy reading a book.Studying heritage language learners reveal that a person with a vocabulary size of 2,500 passive word-families and 2,000 active word-families can speak a language fluently.Many people do not know what a heritage language learner is.  Let's say a person from Mexico moves to the US at the age of 5.  The person knows basic Spanish and is fluent for a 5 year old but eventually English will become dominant.  This person whose first language is Spanish actually does not know many Spanish words and must study Spanish to retain it.  Because they grew up for 5 years speaking Spanish, they are a different type of language learners.  This type of person is considered a heritage language learner.GOOD NEWS - If your goal is to speak English fluently, you are not required to study 10,000 words. 2,000 is enough to get you started.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});Here is another list of things to consider before studying vocabularyBefore studying vocabulary, understand the difference between each word in a word-family. By doing so, you will be able to understand how to use words more easily. A word-family is a grouping of words derived from the same base. For example, active, actively, activities, and activity are all in the same word-family.There is a difference between passive vocabulary and active vocabulary. Passive vocabulary is used in reading and listening, where you are receiving information. Active vocabulary is used in writing and speaking, where you are giving information. In reading, you have time to think. If you want to be fluent, you don't have time to think because the definition of fluent is to speak smoothly and easily.Your goal should be to increase the depth of your vocabulary knowledge instead of the breadth of your vocabulary knowledge. There are many English learners who know 8,000 words, but they cannot speak a single sentence. On the other hand, there are people who know only 2,000 words and they can speak fluently. The difference is how deeply you know a word. Knowing 10,000 words passively will not help you with speaking. Instead focus on learning the first 2,000 words deeply.Learning vocabulary by memorizing the definition in your native language is an inefficient way to learn words. Rather, reading is the best way to increase your vocabulary. Learn words by seeing the word in a sentence. You can look up words in a dictionary, but study them in sentences, not the word itself.The vocabulary words in the list below were created by extracting words from dialogs totaling more than 250,000 words. The only words to make it into the top 2,000 words were those that were present in 1) The British National Corpus top 3,000 words, 2) The Corpus of Contemporary American English top 5,000 words, and 3) The 3,000 most frequently spoken words from Longman Communication.If you had to choose the first 2,000 words to learn, the list below is very accurate.  The number next to the link is the actual number.Top 2000 English Vocabulary Words used in Speaking (2265)Out of the 2265 words in the list, a total of 1867 word families were present.Top 2000 Word Families (1867)The following is broken down by type of words. All the words in the following lists are in the list of 2000 words. The sum is greater than 2,000 because many words can be both a noun and a verb.Finally, before you start studying vocabulary, keep in mind that you will need to learn a lot more than 2,000 words.  However, studying the right 2,000 words in the proper depth will help you to become fluent in English much faster.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});",link:"http://www.talkenglish.com/vocabulary/english-vocabulary.aspx",lessons:[]},{title:"ESL Vocabulary Lessons",hidden:!0,description:"TalkEnglish.com identified the most common words that are used with over 2,000 most frequently used vocabulary words in spoken English and provided example sentences using that word.  Here are two example sentences using the word friend:“She talks to her best friend every day.”(best)“She has been a loyal friend for many years.”(loyal, real, trusted, true, faithful)The word that is being studied is always underlined.  The word that is commonly used with the word you are studying is always bolded.  The words in parentheses are other words that you can use in the same sentence.There are over 2000 lessons with many example sentences that will help you learn how to use each word easily and correctly.You may click on any word in the vocabulary page, or you can search by the following:Search by FrequencySearch by LetterSearch by Word(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});",link:"http://www.talkenglish.com/how-to-use/example-sentences.aspx",lessons:[]}]},{title:"English Speaking Articles",description:"",sections:[{title:"5 Rules for Speaking Fluency",description:'<div><h2>1. Don&apos;t study grammar too much</h2>This rule might sound strange to many ESL students, but it is one of the most important rules. If you want to pass examinations, then study grammar. However, if you want to become fluent in English, then you should try to learn English without studying the grammar.<br><br>Studying grammar will only slow you down and confuse you. You will think about the rules when creating sentences instead of naturally saying a sentence like a native. Remember that only a small fraction of English speakers know more than 20% of all the grammar rules. Many ESL students know more grammar than native speakers. I can confidently say this with experience. I am a native English speaker, majored in English Literature, and have been teaching English for more than 10 years. However, many of my students know more details about English grammar than I do. I can easily look up the definition and apply it, but I don&apos;t know it off the top of my head.<br><br>I often ask my native English friends some grammar questions, and only a few of them know the correct answer. However, they are fluent in English and can read, speak, listen, and communicate effectively.<br><br>Do you want to be able to recite the definition of a causative verb, or do you want to be able to speak English fluently?<br><br><h2>2. Learn and study phrases</h2>Many students learn vocabulary and try to put many words together to create a proper sentence. It amazes me how many words some of my students know, but they cannot create a proper sentence. The reason is because they didn&apos;t study phrases. When children learn a language, they learn both words and phrases together. Likewise, you need to study and learn phrases.<br><br>If you know 1000 words, you might not be able to say one correct sentence. But if you know 1 phrase, you can make hundreds of correct sentences. If you know 100 phrases, you will be surprised at how many correct sentences you will be able to say. Finally, when you know only a 1000 phrases, you will be almost a fluent English speaker.<br><br>The <a href="/Speaking/listbasics.aspx">English Speaking Basics</a> section is a great example of making numerous sentences with a single phrase. So don&apos;t spend hours and hours learning many different words. Use that time to study phrases instead and you will be closer to English fluency.<br><br><b>Don&apos;t translate</b><br><br>When you want to create an English sentence, do not translate the words from your Mother tongue. The order of words is probably completely different and you will be both slow and incorrect by doing this. Instead, learn phrases and sentences so you don&apos;t have to think about the words you are saying. It should be automatic.<br><br>Another problem with translating is that you will be trying to incorporate grammar rules that you have learned. Translating and thinking about the grammar to create English sentences is incorrect and should be avoided.<br><br><h2>3. Reading and Listening is NOT enough. Practice Speaking what you hear!</h2>Reading, listening, and speaking are the most important aspects of any language. The same is true for English. However, speaking is the only requirement to be fluent. It is normal for babies and children to learn speaking first, become fluent, then start reading, then writing. So the natural order is listening, speaking, reading, then writing.<br><br><b>First Problem</b><br>Isn&apos;t it strange that schools across the world teach reading first, then writing, then listening, and finally speaking? Although it is different, the main reason is because when you learn a second language, you need to read material to understand and learn it. So even though the natural order is listening, speaking, reading, then writing, the order for ESL students is reading, listening, speaking, then writing.<br><br><b>Second Problem</b><br>The reason many people can read and listen is because that&apos;s all they practice. But in order to speak English fluently, you need to practice speaking. Don&apos;t stop at the listening portion, and when you study, don&apos;t just listen. Speak out loud the material you are listening to and practice what you hear. Practice speaking out loud until your mouth and brain can do it without any effort. By doing so, you will be able to speak English fluently.<br><br><h2>4. Submerge yourself</h2>Being able to speak a language is not related to how smart you are. Anyone can learn how to speak any language. This is a proven fact by everyone in the world. Everyone can speak at least one language. Whether you are intelligent, or lacking some brain power, you are able to speak one language.<br><br>This was achieved by being around that language at all times. In your country, you hear and speak your language constantly. You will notice that many people who are good English speakers are the ones who studied in an English speaking school. They can speak English not because they went to an English speaking school, but because they had an environment where they can be around English speaking people constantly.<br><br>There are also some people who study abroad and learn very little. That is because they went to an English speaking school, but found friends from their own country and didn&apos;t practice English.<br><br>You don&apos;t have to go anywhere to become a fluent English speaker. You only need to surround yourself with English. You can do this by making rules with your existing friends that you will only speak English. You can also carry around an iPod and constantly listen to English sentences. As you can see, you can achieve results by changing what your surroundings are. Submerge yourself in English and you will learn several times faster.<br><br>TalkEnglish Offline Version is now ready for download. &#xA0;In this package, you can utilize over 8000 audio files to completely surround yourself in English. &#xA0;There are over 13.5 hours of audio files that are not available in the web form. &#xA0;All conversations and all sentences are included, so even if you don&apos;t have many English speaking friends, you can constantly surround yourself in English using your MP3 player. &#xA0;This package is available at the <a href="/english-download.aspx">English Download</a> page. &#xA0;Take advantage of this opportunity and start learning English faster. &#xA0;Click on the link or go to <a href="/english-download.aspx">http://www.talkenglish.com/english-download.aspx</a>.<br><br><h2>5. Study correct material</h2>A common phrase that is incorrect is, &quot;Practice makes perfect.&quot; This is far from the truth. Practice only makes what you are practicing permanent. If you practice the incorrect sentence, you will have perfected saying the sentence incorrectly. Therefore, it is important that you study material that is commonly used by most people.<br><br>Another problem I see is that many students study the news. However, the language they speak is more formal and the content they use is more political and not used in regular life. It is important to understand what they are saying, but this is more of an advanced lesson that should be studied after learning the fundamental basics of English.<br><br>Studying English with a friend who is not a native English speaker is both good and bad. You should be aware of the pros and cons of speaking with a non native speaking friend. Practicing with a non native person will give you practice. You can also motivate each other and point out basic mistakes. But you might pick up bad habits from one another if you are not sure about what are correct and incorrect sentences. So use these practice times as a time period to practice the correct material you studied. Not to learn how to say a sentence.<br><br>In short, study English material that you can trust, that is commonly used, and that is correct.<br><br><b>Summary</b><br><br>These are the rules that will help you achieve your goal of speaking English fluently.

Grammar is most effective to improve communication and writing skills, but this only pertains to those who have a solid foundation in English fluency.<br><br>If you are studying for an exam or want to learn the details of grammar rules, you can study our grammar section at <a href="/Grammar/Grammar.aspx">English Grammar Basics</a>.<br><br>One commonality among everyone in the whole world is that they learned to speak before they learned grammar. Speaking is the first step for any English learner. So if you are a novice at English, please focus on your speaking and listening skills prior to studying grammar. After being able to speak English fluently, you will realize how much easier grammar is. But it does not work the other way around. Being fluent in English speaking will help you with your grammar studies, but studying grammar will NOT help you with your speaking.<br><br>In this article, the four most basic grammar topics are explained, which consists of 1) subject, 2) predicate, 3) verb, and 4) article. &#xA0;This is the absolute minimum you should know. &#xA0;After you become comfortable with speaking, then you can study more advanced grammar topics. &#xA0;For now, please review and study the four items described below.<br><br><h2>What is a subject?</h2>The subject in a sentence is &quot;who&quot; or &quot;what&quot; you are talking about. Every sentence needs a subject. If you don&apos;t have a subject, then the sentence is incorrect and nobody will understand what you are talking about.<br><br>In other languages, the subject is not always required. Verbally, the person listening to you will understand what you are talking about, so a subject is not required. In English, a subject is always required.<br><br>Here are examples of small sentences with the subject underlined.<br><br>&quot;<u>I</u> am hungry&quot;<br>&quot;<u>My brother</u> is very smart&quot;<br>&quot;<u>That computer</u> is very expensive&quot;<br>&quot;<u>We</u> are going to the store now&quot;<br>&quot;<u>My sister</u> and I will be waiting here&quot;<br>&quot;<u>The building</u> is very big&quot;<br><br><br>&quot;When are <u>you</u> going to eat lunch?&quot;<br>&quot;Why are <u>they</u> waiting in line?&quot;<br>&quot;Who is going to take <u>you</u> to the store?&quot;<br><br><br><h2>What is a predicate?</h2>The predicate in a sentence is the section that informs the person what the subject is or what it is doing. It is a phrase that contains a verb. The verb is always in the predicate.<br><br>Let&apos;s look at the sentences we used in the subject lesson to identify the predicates. They will be underlined.<br><br>&quot;I <u>am hungry</u>&quot;<br>&quot;My brother <u>is very smart</u>&quot;<br>&quot;That computer <u>is very expensive</u>&quot;<br>&quot;We <u>are going to the store now</u>&quot;<br>&quot;The building <u>is very big</u>&quot;<br><br>In the above short sentences, we have identified the subject and predicate. In the most basic sentences, you need a subject and an action associated with the subject. Let&apos;s go on to verbs to understand this in more detail.<br><br><h2>What is a verb?</h2>A verb is an action, existence, or occurrence. In the simple sentences we used so far, the verb is mostly in the existence form. They are &quot;am&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, and &quot;are&quot;.<br><br>Other types of verbs are action verbs such as:<br><br>Wash<br>Run<br>Walk<br>Throw<br>Jump<br>Dance<br>Laugh<br>Learn<br>Teach<br><br>There are many action verbs, but I only listed a few to let you know what I am referring to. Here are some sentences to help you understand.<br><br>&quot;I need to <u>wash</u> my face&quot;<br>&quot;Jane<u> taught</u> Jill&quot;<br>&quot;Mike is <u>laughing</u>&quot;<br><br><br>A verb can also start at the beginning of the sentence.<br><br>&quot;<u>Throw</u> the ball at the catcher&quot;<br>&quot;<u>Run</u> towards the finish line&quot;<br><br>It is important to understand the verb, but having just a subject and a verb is not sufficient. For example, &quot;Jill run&quot; is not a complete sentence. Although Jill can be the subject, and &quot;run&quot; is the verb, this is not a complete sentence. That is why the previous lesson on predicate is important. With the predicate, we can turn the sentence into a proper sentence. &quot;Jill is running&quot;<br><br><h2>What is an Article?</h2>Articles seem so easy, but it is extremely difficult to teach.<br><br>&quot;A&quot;, &quot;An&quot;, and &quot;The&quot; are all articles. It is easy to explain the difference between them, but it is difficult to explain when they are used.<br><br>&quot;A&quot; and &quot;An&quot; have the same meaning. They are both indefinite articles. They are only different depending on what word or sound is following. Here is a brief explanation.<br><br>You should use &quot;A&quot; when the following word starts with a consonant.<br><br>&quot;A dog...&quot;<br>&quot;A boy...&quot;<br>&quot;A building...&quot;<br>&quot;A hamburger...&quot;<br><br>You should use &quot;An&quot; when the following starts with a vowel sound.<br><br>&quot;An eagle...&quot;<br>&quot;An umbrella...&quot;<br>&quot;An elephant...&quot;<br>&quot;An awesome book...&quot;<br><br>&quot;The&quot; is a definite article. The difference is if the noun or subject you are talking about is specific or not. Examples are the best way to understand the difference, so let&apos;s take a look.<br><br>If you say, &quot;I am going to a library to study&quot;, then the person you are speaking with does not know which library. If you say, &quot;I am going to the library to study&quot;, then the person you are speaking with knows the specific library you are going to.<br><br>&quot;I am going to a coffee shop&quot; (No specific coffee shop)<br>&quot;I am going to the coffee shop&quot; (A specific coffee shop both the speaker and listener know)<br><br>Here is a slightly different example, but still using the same concept of specific or general.<br><br>&quot;I am going to sit in front of one of the computers in the lab&quot;<br>&quot;I am going to buy a computer&quot;<br><br>Although the computer in the lab can be one of many computers, the correct article is &quot;the&quot; because it is still a specific computer that exists in the lab. However, if you say you are going to buy a computer, you cannot use &quot;the&quot; unless you already have the computer specified. Buying a computer can be any brand, type, or size so it is very general. Therefore, you must use &quot;A&quot; in this type of sentence.<br><br>Here is another type of example:<br><br>&quot;The heat wave is unbearable&quot;<br>&quot;I heard a heat wave is coming&quot;<br><br>The difference between these two sentences is that the &quot;heat wave&quot; is specified in the first sentence, and not specified in the second sentence. In the first sentence, the heat wave is already present and both the speaker and listener knows that the heat wave they are talking about is the one they are currently experiencing. The second sentence is referring to a future heat wave that is not specific.<br><br><h2>When and When NOT to use an article</h2>One common rule to keep in mind is that articles are not used when referring to a name.<br><br>&quot;Turn right at the burger store&quot;<br>&quot;Turn right at McDonalds&quot;<br><br>&quot;The boy was running very fast&quot;<br>&quot;Mike was running very fast&quot;<br><br>Another example of when not to use an article is when referring to general things in conversation.<br><br>&quot;Too much alcohol is bad for you&quot;<br>&quot;Cigarettes can cause lung cancer&quot;<br><br> When you are referring to sports, you do not need an article.<br><br>&quot;I love playing badminton&quot; <br>&quot;Football is a dangerous sport&quot;<br><br>In most cases, you don&apos;t need an article when referring to a country except when the name is referring to multiple countries or regions. For example, if you say &quot;England&quot; or &quot;Scotland&quot;, you don&apos;t need an article, but if you are referring to &quot;The United Kingdom&quot; or &quot;The United States&quot;, then you do need an article.<br></div>',link:"http://www.talkenglish.com/grammar/grammar-speaking.aspx",lessons:[]},{title:"Intonation and Speed",description:"<div><h2>Intonation</h2>Many people from different countries have improper intonation because their teacher had improper intonation. In many situations, being monotone is better than having bad intonation. The worst is when someone goes up and down too much on every word. Another thing you should avoid is to end high at the end of a sentence.<br><br>To correct improper intonation, you need to remember to start high and end low. You cannot do it any other way. I recommend going to the interview section and listening to one of the audio files provided by a native speaker. You will hear proper intonation. After listening to the audio, record yourself and listen to it. Does it sound the same? If not, then find the areas that are dissimilar and make the necessary corrections.<br><br>This advice is very trivial, but intonation is relatively easy to correct. You can fix your intonation with only a little effort. If you have a friend who is a native English speaker, you can usually fix intonation in a couple of lessons. Recording yourself and listening to yourself might be tedious, but having correct intonation can go a long way.<br><br>I have had many students who fixed their intonation after 2 small sessions. The advice I gave them was the same as the one above. This will work, and if you want to speak with proper intonation, please follow this advice.<br><br><h2>Speed of speaking</h2>A common mistake of people who obtain English fluency with improper pronunciation and intonation is the speed in which they speak. Because they do not have perfect pronunciation and intonation, it is difficult to understand people who speak too fast. This is the biggest problem I have seen from people who gain confidence in speaking.<br><br>In order to improve your communication, and to hear &quot;excuse me&quot; less often, it is important to have the correct speed of speaking. For people with confidence, my advice is to slow down and to speak clearly. Don&apos;t blend words together too much and make sure to separate words with a small pause for words that are difficult to pronounce.<br></div>",

Even after years of studying, they go to an English speaking country and realize that they cannot say one sentence correctly. This is going to change for people who finish this course. You will be able to speak English in many different situations. This site will give you the foundation you need to communicate effectively in English.</p><p><b>Speak English fluently without thinking about the rules and logic.<br>You need to mimic correct sentences over and over again.</b><br>Do you have to memorize English or do you have to understand the English to speak it? Let&apos;s first think about how people learn their first language. When you were little, you listened to your parents speak and you copied them. Over the years, people have tried to learn English like they learn a concept or a theory. They try to understand the meaning behind each sentence and try to put them together through logic. If you are studying to pass the GMAT or TOEFL or any other test, then you will have to try to understand every word of every sentence and know why each word is in a particular place. But when you speak English, you don&apos;t need to know any rules. The more rules and logic you think about, the harder time you will have. The best way to learn to speak English is to memorize. First, have a sentence that is correct. Listen to the sentence, repeat the sentence over and over again until it becomes a part of you.</p><p><b>Did you learn to speak through all the classes you took?<br>Don&apos;t worry any longer. TalkEnglish.com will be your guide to speaking English.</b><br>Being able to speak English is more difficult than people realize. If you have bought many books and attended many classes in English only to get disappointed and discouraged, you can be confident that TalkEnglish.com will be different. Anybody who completes this program will have the ability to speak to anyone in any situation.</p><p><b>Are you talking after thinking about all the words?<br>You have to speak without thinking instantly.</b><br>When I ask you for your background information in your language, you don&apos;t have to think about each word that you are going to say. You are basically thinking about the content. When you know what you want to say, you can say it automatically. This is because you have everything already memorized. When you want to speak effectively in English, you have to recall information immediately. In order to do so, you must have the sentences already memorized. If you have something memorized, you will be able to say it immediately. For example, you probably learned how to say, &apos;How are you doing?&apos; You don&apos;t have to think about this sentence because you practiced it so many times. Imagine if you can say other things as quickly as you can say &apos;How are you doing?&quot; That is what you will be learning.</p><p><b>Practice with sentences that are most commonly used.<br>TalkEnglish.com does not contain any awkward sentences.</b><br>All the content on this site is the most commonly used sentences that everyone will understand. In many text books, there are many sentences that are awkward. Because you do not know which ones are proper or not, you might be wasting time and energy on sentences that are not used. With TalkEnglish.com, you will only be studying sentences that are used frequently and by everyone. You don&apos;t have to worry about memorizing thousands of sentences that you are not sure about.</p><p><b>Learning listening skills will not improve your speaking skills.<br>TalkEnglish.com focuses solely on teaching you how to speak in English.</b><br>Many people study television news programs to improve spoken English. Your listening skills will improve, but your speaking abilities will stay the same. Ask if studying news will help you speak English in a normal setting. If you practice saying, &quot;In Iraq today, 200 US troops have evacuated the perimeter near Baghdad due to constant surprise attacks by the remaining rebels&quot;, will it really help you speak to a regular English speaking person. Wouldn&apos;t you rather learn how to say something that will be used in daily conversation?<br><br></p></div>',link:"http://www.talkenglish.com/studymethod.aspx",lessons:[]}]}]};!function(){"use strict";var e=$("#sideBarTpl").html(),s=Handlebars.compile(e),t=$("#sectionTpl").html(),n=Handlebars.compile(t),l=new Audio;l.onended=function(){$(".playingAudio").removeClass("playingAudio")},l.onerror=function(e){console.log("fail playing, try again ",e),l.play()};var i=!!window.opr&&!!opr.addons||!!window.opera||navigator.userAgent.indexOf(" OPR/")>=0,o="undefined"!=typeof InstallTrigger,a=Object.prototype.toString.call(window.HTMLElement).indexOf("Constructor")>0,h=!!document.documentMode,r=!h&&!!window.StyleMedia,d=!!window.chrome&&!!window.chrome.webstore,w=(d||i)&&!!window.CSS;window.browser={isOpera:i,isFirefox:o,isSafari:a,isIE:h,isEdge:r,isChrome:d,isBlink:w};var c=0;(browser.isOpera||browser.isFirefox||browser.isSafari||browser.isEdge||browser.isChrome||browser.isBlink)&&(c=200),$(".modal-trigger").leanModal({in_duration:c,out_duration:c}),$("#slideNav").html(s(lessonsDataJson)),$(".button-collapse").sideNav(),$(".collapsible").collapsible(),$("li.section-item").click(function(){$(".section-item").removeClass("selected"),$(this).addClass("selected"),$(".button-collapse").sideNav("hide");var e=$(this).index(),s=$(this).parents(".category-item").index(),t=lessonsDataJson.categories[s].sections[e];$("#mainContent").html(n(t)),$("#sectionDesc").html(t.description),$("body,html").scrollTop(0),$(".masonry").masonry({itemSelector:".grid-item",columnWidth:".grid-item",percentPosition:!0})}),$(document).on("click",".lesson-item",function(){$("#modalLesson").openModal({in_duration:c,out_duration:c,complete:function(){l.pause()}}),$("#lessonContent").empty(),$("#modalLesson .modal-content").scrollTop(0);var e=$(this).data("lesson");$.getJSON("data/lessons/"+e+".json",function(e){$("#lessonTitle").text(e.title),e.html=e.html.replace('<br><br><b>Download all the conversations</b> for your mp3 player.
