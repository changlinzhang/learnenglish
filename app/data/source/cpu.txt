CPU	Processes instructions and executes them
Clock Speed	measures how many fetch/execute/decode cycles happen every second
Cores	Separate processors. More cores=more information processed at same time
Cache size	fast memory that stores most commonly used instructions
Address bus	Carries addresses from the processor to memory and input and output devices.
Data Bus	Sends data between the processor, memory and input/output devices.
Control Bus	Carries signals to coordinate all the computer activities.
Control Unit	Coordinates all the activities taking place inside the CPU.
ALU (arithmetic and logic unit)	Handles all the arithmetic/ logical operations.
Register	A register is a very fast memory location within the CPU.
Program counter (PC)	holds the memory address of the next instruction to be processed.
Current instruction Register (CIR)	holds the current instruction to be executed, which has been copied from MDR.
Accumulator	All calculations are carried out here.
