What do you think about him?&quot;<br>B: &quot;He&apos;s a terrible instructor and demands a lot, but fortunately, he&apos;s an easy grader.&quot;<br>A: &quot;What did you end up getting?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I got an A-. Sounds good, but none of my test scores were that high, so I don&apos;t know how I got a decent grade.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That&apos;s probably because he grades on a curve.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Are you enjoying the class so far?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I hate it and I was about to withdrawal. But after hearing your experience, I think I will tough it out.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Yes. Definitely stay in the class. You will get a better grade than your test scores. He does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Thanks for letting me know. I feel relieved now.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
