She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Tell me about it. If I was as small as her, I wouldn&apos;t think about going on a diet.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Me too. But what are we going to do? I have been on 4 different diets and I can&apos;t seem to lose weight.&quot;<br>B: &quot;That&apos;s because you don&apos;t exercise. If you were more active, you wouldn&apos;t have a dieting problem.&quot;<br>A: &quot;What do you know? You are over weight too.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I&apos;m not on a diet though.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I know. But I don&apos;t have someone to diet with. If we help each other and motivate each other, then I think we can lose some weight.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I like ice cream too much though.&quot;<br>A: &quot;C&apos;mon. You&apos;ll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there.&quot;<br>B: &quot;It does sound appealing.&quot;<br>A: &quot;It&apos;s a great idea. I can&apos;t believe I didn&apos;t think of this earlier. Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Okay. I&apos;m in. Let&apos;s do it.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Great. I&apos;ll get our plan started right away.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Can we start tomorrow though?&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
