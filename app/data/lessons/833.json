But this is still a good school.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I&apos;m not complaining. I just know that I wanted to come to California. Texas is cool and all, but I wanted to experience different things.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That&apos;s good. Do you know what you plan on majoring in?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I was thinking about political science, but now I&apos;m leaning towards English literature. How about you?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I plan on majoring in double E.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Do you know where the Smith building is? I have to pick up the syllabus for my psychology class.
