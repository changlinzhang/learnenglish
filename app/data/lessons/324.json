I don&apos;t want it pooping all over.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P207/sentence/P207S12.mp3\">I think we should get some squeaky toys.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P207/sentence/P207S13.mp3\">I say we ask someone at the store what they recommend.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P207/sentence/P207S14.mp3\">I think we should keep the crate in our bedroom.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P207/sentence/P207S15.mp3\">I think we should keep the crate in the garage.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P207/sentence/P207S16.mp3\">Since she is a puppy we should definitely pick up anything around the house she can chew.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P207/sentence/P207S17.mp3\">Yes, we need to put away anything we don&apos;t want it to chew on.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P207/sentence/P207S18.mp3\">Yes we need a collar and leash so we can take it on walks.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P207/sentence/P207S19.mp3\">I think we should get a collar with sparkly diamonds on it.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P207/sentence/P207S20.mp3\">We should feed it in the kitchen.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P207/sentence/P207S21.mp3\">We should feed it in its cage.</a>&quot;<br>\r\n"
