I heard a lot about it. Is it really that fun?&quot;<br>A: &quot;For me, it&apos;s one of those games that are fun to both watch and play.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Are you a football player?&quot;<br>A: &quot;No, just for fun with my friends. We play two hand touch or flag football. We&apos;re too old to play tackle football.&quot;<br>B: &quot;What is two hand touch and flag football?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Instead of tackling somebody, you just have to touch them with two hands, or if it is flag football, grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I see. It&apos;s safer then right?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Exactly. We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts. If you want to learn and play a little, you&apos;re welcome to join us.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I&apos;ll give it a try. Give me a call and let&apos;s go down together.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Ok.
