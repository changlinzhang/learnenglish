I heard about your break up. You must be devastated.&quot;<br>B: &quot;It&apos;s more than I can bear. I don&apos;t think I can go on.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Come on Mike. It&apos;s not the end of the world.&quot;<br>B: &quot;It&apos;s the end of my world. She was everything to me. I loved her so much.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I remember my first break up. I remember it was the hardest thing I ever went through. So I know it must be really tough right now.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Every night, I cry myself to sleep. Can you believe that I actually cry everyday?&quot;<br>A: &quot;It&apos;s normal to cry. You shouldn&apos;t feel bad about it. It&apos;s the only way to let it out.&quot;<br>B: &quot;How long will I feel like this? How long is the pain going to last?&quot;<br>A: &quot;It&apos;s different for everyone, but it took me four months to get over Jessica.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Four months... I have to live in hell for four months...&quot;<br>A: &quot;But I&apos;m ok now. I moved on and I&apos;m dating other great people. I know you will be better.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Why do you think she left me?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I really don&apos;t know. Some people change and they want to go in different directions.&quot;<br>B: &quot;But I loved her so much. I loved her more than anything in this world. She was my world.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I know you love her.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be able to love anyone again.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I thought that too. I thought Jessica was the only person I would ever love. But it changes. It really does. You&apos;ll get better and become a stronger person.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I hope so.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
