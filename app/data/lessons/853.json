What did you do last weekend?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Josh had a bunch of guys over at his house and we played poker.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Why didn&apos;t you guys call me?&quot;<br>B: &quot;We did. But you weren&apos;t home. If you had a cell phone, maybe you wouldn&apos;t be left out.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Yeah. I need to get a cell phone. So, what games did you play?&quot;<br>B: &quot;We only play Texas Hold &apos;em.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That&apos;s all good. What was the bid amount?&quot;<br>B: &quot;We started playing no limit. It&apos;s so much fun.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That sounds awesome. Let me join you next time.&quot;<br>B: &quot;No problem. Just get a cell phone so we can contact you.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Aright. Who won though?&quot;<br>B: &quot;John. He always wins. He&apos;s damn good.&quot;<br>A: &quot;You only played one game?&quot;<br>B: &quot;We played 2 games and he won both of them.&quot;<br>A: &quot;What is the buy in?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Only 10 bucks.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That sounds fun. Ten bucks isn&apos;t that much money to have fun while chilling with your friends.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Exactly.&quot;<br>A: &quot;But what happens if you get out in the first ten minutes?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Then you&apos;re screwed. You can watch tv or play the XBOX.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Better not die soon then. So, when is the next time you guys are playing?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Probably this Friday. Give me a call Friday morning and I&apos;ll let you know the exact time.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
