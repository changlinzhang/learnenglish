    "html": "\r\n<h1>\r\nAfter the Meeting\r\n</h1>\r\nIt is common to talk about meetings afterwards. &#xA0;Sometimes it is to say how useless it was, or that you were bored, but there are times when someone might ask you for feedback. &#xA0;Other times, you might want feedback if you were the person holding the meeting. &#xA0;Let&apos;s cover these here.<br><br><b>Asking for Feedback</b><br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S1.mp3\">What did you think about my presentation?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S2.mp3\">Did you think the meeting went ok?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S3.mp3\">Can you provide feedback on the meeting we just had?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S4.mp3\">Did you find the meeting useful?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S5.mp3\">Did the meeting help to clarify the current situation?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S6.mp3\">Is there any part of our discussion during the meeting that you are still unsure about?</a>&quot;<br><br><b>Providing Feedback</b><br><br>Even if you think the meeting was boring and useless, you can&apos;t say that unless you are talking to a close friend. &#xA0;Many times in the office, you have to give a professional answer.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S7.mp3\">I thought the presentation went well. &#xA0;You provided great information and I think everyone was impressed.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S8.mp3\">The meeting went well. &#xA0;We covered a lot of information and made some important decisions.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S9.mp3\">The whole presentation went pretty well, but next time I would recommend that you talk a little slower. &#xA0;When we were running out of time, you started speaking too fast and it was hard to keep up.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S10.mp3\">Most of the time, our weekly meeting is pretty dull, but today was quite useful.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B33/sentence/B33S11.mp3\">I understand what is happening to our project now, but I&apos;m still unclear about exactly who is affected by this change.</a>&quot;\r\n"
