Have you lost weight?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Hi Julie. Yeah. I&apos;ve been on a diet for a couple of months now.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Wow. You look great.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Thanks for noticing.&quot;<br>A: &quot;What type of diet were you on?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating. With a combination of eating better and exercising, I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That&apos;s amazing. What tips did your trainer give you?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Mostly on how to exercise, but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits. Instead of eating 3 times a day, she told me to eat 5 times a day.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That doesn&apos;t make sense. If you eat more, than how do you lose weight?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Actually, I&apos;m eating the same amount. I eat 5 smaller meals a day. Basically, it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That makes sense. I&apos;m going to try that.&quot;<br>B: &quot;You don&apos;t need to lose weight.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Ah... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Thanks for the advice.&quot;<br>B: &quot;No problem.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
