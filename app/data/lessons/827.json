You look terrible. What&apos;s wrong?&quot;<br>B: &quot;My grandmother just passed away.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I&apos;m so sorry to hear that. When did this happen?&quot;<br>B: &quot;A couple of days ago. I just go back from the funeral.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Is there anything I can do?&quot;<br>B: &quot;No... not really. The sad thing is that I wasn&apos;t there when she died. I really wanted to be there one last time.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I&apos;m sure she knew you loved her. Did she pass away in the hospital?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Yeah. She died in her sleep.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I&apos;m sorry she&apos;s gone.&quot;<br>B: &quot;At least she didn&apos;t suffer.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I think your grandmother would want you to think of all the good times you spent together.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I know. But I miss her.&quot;<br>A: &quot;When my grandmother passed away, I frequently visited her in the cemetery. I always talked to her. Even though she wasn&apos;t there, I somehow knew she heard what I said.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Yeah? That&apos;s what I was thinking too. Thanks.&quot;<br>A: &quot;It looks like you haven&apos;t eaten anything all day. We should get you something to eat.&quot;<br>B: &quot;You&apos;re right... I should eat something. Let&apos;s go.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
