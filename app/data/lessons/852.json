I shot a 13.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Not too bad. I thought you were going to break single.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I had a chance. I shot a 4 on the front nine, but the back nine killed me.&quot;<br>A: &quot;What happened?&quot;<br>B: &quot;My drive was totally off. All of the sudden, I started hooking the ball. I hit two balls OB, and that killed my score right there.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That sucks. You could have broken single if it wasn&apos;t for the penalty strokes.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Yeah. I was so frustrated after that hole. But overall, I shot well, so I&apos;m not too disappointed. How about you? How have you been hitting lately?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I hit great on the range, but when I get on the course, I can&apos;t seem to hit the ball right.&quot;<br>B: &quot;That happened to me for the longest time. It just takes time and practice. When you go out on the course more often, that problem will fix itself.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I&apos;m still trying to break 90. I&apos;ve been hitting in the mid nineties for ever.&quot;<br>B: &quot;How far does your driver go?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I don&apos;t use it that much. I use my 3 wood more. I&apos;m not consistent with the driver to use it.&quot;<br>B: &quot;You gotta keep practicing with it. Eventually you&apos;ll get the hang of it.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Yeah. I practice with it on the range, but I&apos;m not making any progress on it.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Let&apos;s go to the range together and I&apos;ll check out your swing.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That sounds good. Let&apos;s go tomorrow night.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Ok. That will give us practice for our round on Wednesday.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I&apos;ll meet you there at 6:30.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Ok. See you tomorrow then.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
