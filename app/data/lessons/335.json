Below we will take a look at some questions involving the decision making process when looking at and ultimately choosing a cell phone.<br><br>Here are some questions commonly used when talking about cell phones.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S1.mp3\">With all the cell companies out there how do I decide who to go with?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S2.mp3\">Should I ever consider a pre paid cell phone?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S3.mp3\">I have never text before. &#xA0;Would you recommend getting a phone I can text with?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S4.mp3\">How important are all the applications you can get for your phone?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S5.mp3\">Should I purchase a phone that is blue tooth compatible?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S6.mp3\">What kind of plans are there to buy?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S7.mp3\">Should I buy a warranty?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S8.mp3\">Should I consider a family plan and purchase phones for them?</a>&quot;<br><br>If you are asked any of these questions, here are ways that you could respond.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S9.mp3\">I would go do some research and compare companies, that way you can try and get the best deal.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S10.mp3\">I would go off of recommendations from friends. &#xA0;See who they are with and who they like.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S11.mp3\">I would maybe consider getting a pre paid phone if you were buying one for of your kids. &#xA0;You can put a certain amount of money on it that they can&apos;t go over. &#xA0;So that way you can keep them from charging up the bill.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S12.mp3\">I have never used a pre paid phone. &#xA0;I don&apos;t see why you just don&apos;t get a regular one.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S13.mp3\">Yes, texting is great and it&apos;s a fun way to talk and keep in touch.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S14.mp3\">Most phones you can text with. &#xA0;I would look for one with a bigger keypad so it&apos;s easier to use.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S15.mp3\">Applications are fun. &#xA0;Some phones have free ones and others you can buy.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S16.mp3\">I use applications on my phone all the time. &#xA0;I have one for music, one for games, and one I use as a GPS.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S17.mp3\">Blue tooth is a wireless earpiece used for hands free talking. &#xA0;I would highly recommend getting one.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S18.mp3\">Yes I would make sure it is blue tooth compatible. &#xA0;In some states it is illegal to talk while driving but if you&apos;re using a blue tooth it&apos;s ok.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S19.mp3\">Every company has different plans. &#xA0;I would just ask when I go there to look at phones.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S20.mp3\">I would get a plan with free long distance and free texting.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S21.mp3\">I always buy a warranty. &#xA0;That way if you break your phone they will replace it.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S22.mp3\">I think warrantees are a waste of money. &#xA0;If my phone breaks I just buy a new one.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S23.mp3\">I would first look into the prices for family plans if you&apos;re interested.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P218/sentence/P218S24.mp3\">Family plans are great. &#xA0;Your whole family can get their own phones and it&apos;s a good way to keep in touch with busy teenagers.</a>&quot;<br>\r\n"
