    "html": "\r\n<h1>\r\nExaminations - Finding Information\r\n</h1>\r\nHaving a lot of information about tests can help prepare for exams. &#xA0;The next several questions are geared towards finding specific information.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S1.mp3\">Does Professor Giles use old exam questions for his tests?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S2.mp3\">Can I borrow your old exams for Intermediate Accounting? &#xA0;I want to use the questions to test myself before the real exam.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S3.mp3\">Do you know anybody who took Physics 340? &#xA0;I want to know the types of questions that were asked on the final.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S4.mp3\">Do you think I need to study chapter 6 for the mid-term? &#xA0;It&apos;s so boring, and I can&apos;t seem to apply it anywhere.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S5.mp3\">What topics did the professor cover the most in the final exam?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S6.mp3\">What were the long essay questions on?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S7.mp3\">Do you remember the long essay questions you had on the final?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S8.mp3\">I was thinking about buying the study supplement for the engineering class. &#xA0;Do you think it will help?</a>&quot;<br><br>And of course, you may be required to answer these types of questions, so let&apos;s get into answering:<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S9.mp3\">How many tests did you have to take in your Math class?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S10.mp3\">We had a total of 4 tests in that math class.</a>&quot; &#xA0;Or more simply, &apos;4 tests.&apos;<br><br>Answering can be real easy. &#xA0;The reason I put full sentences is for your practice. &#xA0;But remember when you really answer, you are not required to put them in full sentences. &#xA0;I&apos;ll try to mix it up so you get a familiar feel answering both long and short ways.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S11.mp3\">What was the mid-term like?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L49/sentence/L49S12.mp3\">The mid-term was hard. &#xA0;If you read all the material, you will still have a hard time because the professor wrote up all the questions in a difficult way.</a>&quot;\r\n"
