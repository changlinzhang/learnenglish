It&apos;s a great place.&quot;<br>B: &quot;What did you do there?&quot;<br>A: &quot;There is so much to do. It&apos;s a big tourist place so there is access to everything.&quot;<br>B: &quot;That&apos;s good. I&apos;m looking forward to our honeymoon. Especially after all the wedding plans I had to do.&quot;<br>A: &quot;How long are you going for?&quot;<br>B: &quot;We decided on 6 days. We are leaving on Sunday and returning on Saturday.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That should give you plenty of time. Do you have all your travel plans in order?&quot;<br>B: &quot;We just booked our flight and got our room. Everything is set.&quot;<br>A: &quot;You&apos;re going to have so much fun. I&apos;m so jealous.&quot;<br>B: &quot;When you get married, you&apos;ll have your chance.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I need to find a guy first.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Where do you want to go for your honeymoon?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Since I&apos;ve been to Mexico and Hawaii before, I want to go to Australia.&quot;<br>B: &quot;That sounds great. It&apos;s a little out of our budget so we didn&apos;t even consider Australia.&quot;<br>A: &quot;For the price, Cancun is one of the best so don&apos;t have any regrets. It is a great place. So do you have a ride to the airport?&quot;<br>B: &quot;My brother is going to drop us off.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Looks like everything is set. Just make sure to take a camera. I know many people who forgot to take a camera on their honeymoon.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Will do. Thanks.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
