    "html": "\r\n<h1>\r\nDating - On the Date\r\n</h1>\r\nWhen you finally see Janet at the restaurant or another dating place, you should say something right when you see her. &#xA0;Here are a few examples<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S1.mp3\">I&apos;m glad you showed up.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S2.mp3\">You look great.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S3.mp3\">Hi Janet. &#xA0;It&apos;s good seeing you again.</a>&quot;<br><br>During the date, you have to make sure the person stays interested. &#xA0;This is primarily done by talking about subjects the other person wants to talk about. &#xA0;In this case, Janet is concentrating on school. &#xA0;Here are some things to say<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S4.mp3\">What subject do you find difficult?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S5.mp3\">What classes are giving you a hard time?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S6.mp3\">Do you like multiple choice questions or short answer questions?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S7.mp3\">Do you like writing essays?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S8.mp3\">What subjects interest you the most?</a>&quot;<br><br>After you find out more information on her interest, then you can say more things about it.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S9.mp3\">When I was in college, I had a hard time with my writing assignments. &#xA0;I guess my high school didn&apos;t prepare me enough. &#xA0;So I went to the writing center located next to the library, and they helped me tremendously.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S10.mp3\">I found psychology to be pretty easy, but I always made stupid mistakes with the multiple choice questions. &#xA0;So I got a study guide for it and it helped me to get the minor details out of the way.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S11.mp3\">I really like history too. &#xA0;I enjoy learning about what happened and how we got to the state we are in now.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L81/sentence/L81S12.mp3\">You don&apos;t like calculus? &#xA0;I was a math major. &#xA0;If you would like, I can help you out with your homework. &#xA0;I&apos;m sure after a couple of lessons, you will think it is easy.</a>&quot;<br><br>So helping out with homework is another way to get another date. &#xA0;Although it will be more geared towards school work, you can take the opportunity to impress the other person.\r\n"
