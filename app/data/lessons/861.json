I used to be scared of a lot of things when I was young, but not anymore.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Are you afraid of death?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Only if I think about it so much. But death is inevitable, so there is no use thinking about it.&quot;<br>A: &quot;How about horror movies?&quot;<br>B: &quot;No. I know they&apos;re all fake so there is nothing to be afraid of. How about you?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I get scared pretty easily. I&apos;m actually frightened of bee&apos;s.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Really? Why?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I don&apos;t know. I got stung when I was young and ever since, I&apos;ve always been afraid of them.&quot;<br>B: &quot;What other things are you afraid of?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Sitting by the camp fire and telling horror stories is very scary.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Wow. You&apos;re afraid of many things huh?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I guess so. Aren&apos;t you afraid of something coming out of the bushes?&quot;<br>B: &quot;It&apos;s not going to happen. We probably went camping dozens of times and nothing ever came out of the bushes. What makes you think something will?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I don&apos;t know. I guess I&apos;m terrified at the possibility.&quot;<br>B: &quot;If you were realistic, you probably wouldn&apos;t be scared of everything. Maybe you have too much imagination.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I should try to think more realistically. I&apos;ll do that.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Good. After awhile, you won&apos;t be afraid of so many things.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
