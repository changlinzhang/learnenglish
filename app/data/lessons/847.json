Guess what?&quot;<br>B: &quot;What?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Robert asked me to marry him. We&apos;re getting married.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Congratulations. I&apos;m so happy for you. So when is the big day?&quot;<br>A: &quot;We haven&apos;t set the date exactly, but it looks like it will be sometime in July.&quot;<br>B: &quot;How did he propose to you?&quot;<br>A: &quot;On valentines day, he got me a present. I thought it was an ordinary valentines day present, but when I opened it, it was this big diamond ring. Right then, he got on his knees and proposed.&quot;<br>B: &quot;That&apos;s so neat. So you really got surprised?&quot;<br>A: &quot;We talked about marriage a little, but I never knew he was serious.&quot;<br>B: &quot;You are going to be busy with wedding plans. But you have several months to prepare for it.&quot;<br>A: &quot;It&apos;s going to be pretty hectic for me. So I&apos;m going to need some help. First of all, I was wondering if you would like to be my Maid of Honor.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I would be honored.&quot;<br>A: &quot;So you&apos;re going to help me with the planning right?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Of course. How many brides maids are you going to have?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Three. So we will have a total of four.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Let me guess. Susan, Tina, and Cindy.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Close. I&apos;m going to have Cindy as the candle lighter. The third brides maid is going to be Lydia. She is a good friend from church.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I know her. She&apos;s sweet. I&apos;ll make sure we have the best wedding for you.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I hope so.
