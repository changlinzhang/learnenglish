You&apos;ve been so busy lately. What have you been up to?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Hey Jackie. I started dating this cute guy and decided to start exercising.&quot;<br>A: &quot;You&apos;re not out of shape. You look fine.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Well, this guy I am seeing is a personal trainer and he has a perfect body. Compared to him, I need some work.&quot;<br>A: &quot;How long have you seen him?&quot;<br>B: &quot;We&apos;ve been together for about a month and a half.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Did you sleep with him yet?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Not yet. But before I get into bed with him, I want to look fit.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That&apos;s not the greatest reason to exercise, but I guess it is a valid one.&quot;<br>B: &quot;How about you? Anything new in your life?&quot;<br>A: &quot;My father is a little ill. He has been to the doctor&apos;s quite a bit lately but they don&apos;t know what is wrong with him. He complains about stomach pains a lot these days.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I&apos;m sorry to hear that. Any idea what could have caused it?&quot;<br>A: &quot;He says it is because he didn&apos;t take care of himself when he was young. That&apos;s why I want to start thinking about my health.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I think it is important to take care of yourself while you are young too. Even though my reasons are not the best, at least I am working on it.&quot;<br>A: &quot;How are your parents doing?&quot;<br>B: &quot;They&apos;re doing great. I&apos;m thankful that they are healthy.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That&apos;s good to hear. Well, I gotta get running now. I&apos;ll catch you later.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Ok. Send my regards to your father.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I will. Thanks.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
