    "html": "\r\n<h1>\r\nReply and Reply All\r\n</h1>\r\nWhen you reply all, it goes out to everyone on the To line and the CC line. &#xA0;Reply only goes to the sender. &#xA0;When we send out a mail to many people, you might see a sentence that says &apos;little &apos;r&apos; me&apos;. &#xA0;This means to use the small R instead of the Big R. &#xA0;That basically means to reply only to me instead of replying to everyone on the mail thread.<br><br>A mail is also referred to as a thread. &#xA0;That is because in the office, a mail can go on back and forth among many people so it becomes a chain of mail that started from one email. &#xA0;I&apos;ll use these terminologies in the next several example sentences.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B24/sentence/B24S1.mp3\">I sent out a mail to the whole group. &#xA0;I requested that they little &apos;r&apos; me with their ideas.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B24/sentence/B24S2.mp3\">When I receive a mail sent out to multiple people, I keep forgetting to send to all.</a>&quot;<br>&#xA0;<br>This next sentence is not a spoken sentence. &#xA0;It&apos;s a common sentence used in email when someone forgets to send to everyone.<br><br>&apos;Resending to include everyone.&apos;<br><br>If you see this, that means the person sent a reply to the sender instead of replying all.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B24/sentence/B24S3.mp3\">Start a mail thread on your idea. I think everyone should get in on this discussion.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B24/sentence/B24S4.mp3\">Do you want me to start a mail thread for this?</a>&quot;\r\n"
