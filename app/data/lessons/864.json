Aren&apos;t you in my sociology class?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I think so. With Professor Robinson right?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Yeah. I&apos;m Nicole.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I&apos;m George. It&apos;s nice to meet you.&quot;<br>A: &quot;How are you liking the class so far?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I like the subject. I think it&apos;s pretty interesting.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Me too. But it&apos;s hard to sit in class when the weather is so nice.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Tell me about it. The weather has been so great lately.&quot;<br>A: &quot;So, what year are you?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I&apos;m a sophomore. How about you?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I&apos;m a freshman.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Where are you from around here?&quot;<br>A: &quot;No. I&apos;m from the east. I grew up in New York.&quot;<br>B: &quot;New York? That seems like a fun place.&quot;<br>A: &quot;More like a busy place. Everyone is always on the run over there.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I grew up in San Francisco.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That&apos;s not too far from here. Do you like living on the west coast?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I haven&apos;t been to many other places, but the west coast is a great place.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Yeah. I like it too.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Are you ready for the mid term next Friday?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I&apos;m so behind. I&apos;ve been going out a lot. I&apos;m having so much fun, but I really need to catch up on my school work.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Where do you usually hang out?&quot;<br>A: &quot;No where specific. We always do different things.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Have you been to Alcatraz yet?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Not yet. I want to go though.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I highly recommend it. It&apos;s an interesting place to visit.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Maybe you could take me there.&quot;<br>B: &quot;If you get a B or better on your midterm, I&apos;ll take you there.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Deal. It was great meeting you. I&apos;ll talk to you again tomorrow.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Ok. See you later.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
