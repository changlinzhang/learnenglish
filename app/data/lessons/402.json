&#xA0;But it is much easier than you think. &#xA0;I&apos;ll explain further.<br><br>We have someone asking about selling a house or something. &#xA0;We have to explain the process. &#xA0;Even if you don&apos;t know the process of selling a house in America, you can use the same guideline for your area of expertise. &#xA0;If you can say each sentence individually, then you can say all of them put together.<br><br>I start by saying there are a couple of ways to sell a house.<br>Then the example says you will explain the more common process.<br><br>From here, it is basically listing steps.<br><br>1. &quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S3.mp3\">The first thing you need to do is find a sellers agent.</a>&quot;<br>2. &quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S4.mp3\">The agent will list your house on the market.</a>&quot;<br>3. &quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S5.mp3\">After the house is on the market, people who are looking to buy a house will find a buyers agent.</a>&quot;<br>4. &quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S6.mp3\">The buyers agent looks through the list of houses for sale posted by the sellers agent.</a>&quot;<br>5. &quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S7.mp3\">The buyers agent shows your house to potential buyers.</a>&quot;<br>6. &quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S8.mp3\">When someone makes an offer, the buyers agent will let the sellers agent know about the price that the buyer has offered.</a>&quot;<br>7. &quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S9.mp3\">After everyone agrees, the house is sold.</a>&quot;<br>8. &quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S10.mp3\">The price associated with selling a house is based on commission.</a>&quot;<br>9. &quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S11.mp3\">The sellers agent will get an average of 2.5 percent of the selling price and the buyers agent will get 2.5 percent as well.</a>&quot;<br>10. &quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B28/sentence/B28S12.mp3\">If the price of the house was $300,000, then each agent will get $7500, costing you a total of $15,000.</a>&quot;<br><br>This list seems pretty simple now. &#xA0;Each sentence is relatively short. &#xA0;There is no difference between the long paragraph and the listed out items. &#xA0;Both contain the same words. &#xA0;All I did was put them together.<br><br>Finally, if you feel that you cannot create these sentences even in a list form, use an example that you are familiar with. &#xA0;I&apos;m sure you will have an easy time creating a list if the topic is in your area of expertise.<br><br>I recommend listening to the paragraph again. &#xA0;But this time, listen to the speed I talk. &#xA0;Also, listen to the pauses after each sentence. &#xA0;Notice that I don&apos;t have unnecessary words like &apos;and&apos;, &apos;moreover&apos;, &apos;furthermore&apos;, &apos;Afterwards&apos;, and so on. &#xA0;These are good words, but you don&apos;t need them that much when you are explaining something verbally. &#xA0;Using pauses between sentences and speaking clearly and slowly is the best way to communicate an explanation.\r\n"
