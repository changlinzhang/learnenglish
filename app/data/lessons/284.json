You will hear only Person B through the audio file. There will be a silence for you to repeat the sentences of Person A. Do the same for Person B. The speed of the conversation is native speed. Use the pause button if the pause between each sentence is too fast for you. After practicing several times, you will be able to speak as fast as a native.<table border=\"0\"><tr><td>1 &#xA0;</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L157/practice/L157P1.mp3\">Listen All</a>&#xA0;&#xA0;|&#xA0;&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L157/practice/L157P1b.mp3\">Person A</a>&#xA0;&#xA0;|&#xA0;&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L157/practice/L157P1a.mp3\">Person B</a></td></tr><tr><td>A: &quot;You don&apos;t look too well.
