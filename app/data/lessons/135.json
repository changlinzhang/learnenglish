    "html": "\r\n<h1>\r\nExercise - US Culture\r\n</h1>\r\nHaving lived in the United States and Korea, I realized one big thing immediately.<br><br>In Korea, I have to do a lot of walking. &#xA0;When I went to school or to work, I had to leave my house, walk to the bus stop or the subway which takes about 10-15 minutes, get off at my destination, and walk the rest of the way, which is another 15 minutes. &#xA0;Total time walking is about 25 minutes. &#xA0;This translates to 50 minutes a day round trip, and about 3-4 kilometers everyday. &#xA0;I didn&apos;t even know it, but I was exercising.<br><br>In America, everyone has a car. &#xA0;While going to work here, I literally walk about 7 minutes a day. &#xA0;That&apos;s a total distance of 300 meters. &#xA0;The reason is because I only have to walk to my car. &#xA0;I drive to work, and then I walk from the parking lot to my office. &#xA0;So, I realized I was gaining weight without having changed anything except the walking I wasn&apos;t doing.<br><br>I suppose that is why in America there is a big hype about exercising and losing weight. &#xA0;If you don&apos;t want to, you don&apos;t have to walk anywhere or exercise at all. &#xA0;In Korea, walking is part of the daily routine. &#xA0;So although you don&apos;t need to know this lesson as much as other lessons, it will still help when talking to foreigners about this subject. &#xA0;Let&apos;s continue with the lesson by doing the practice.<br><br>In the next exercise lesson, we will learn about speaking English in relation to working out in the gym\r\n"
