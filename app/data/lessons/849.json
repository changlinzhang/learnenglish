I follow the Mariners every year.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I wonder how they will do this year.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I don&apos;t know if they have a chance. Did you hear that A-Rod went to the Yankees?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I know. Their team was too good even before getting Alex.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Yeah. The richest team is usually the best team. They need to put a salary cap to make things fair.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I agree. I don&apos;t know why they haven&apos;t done so already.&quot;<br>B: &quot;But don&apos;t lose hope too soon. The Yankees don&apos;t have a good pitching staff this year. They might end up like the Texas Rangers. Great offense, no pitching.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I highly doubt that. Even though they lost Pettite, they still have a decent pitching rotation.&quot;<br>B: &quot;We&apos;ll see. I hope the Mariners do well this year.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Me too. Oh, did you buy any tickets this year?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I got a couple of games with Oakland and Boston, but I couldn&apos;t get anything with the Yankees.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Same here. I went in on the second day and all the tickets with the Yankees were already sold out.&quot;<br>B: &quot;There&apos;s still plenty of other games though. We should go together one of these days.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Sounds good. Let&apos;s plan for late June.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
