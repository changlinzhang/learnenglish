anything to talk about. &#xA0;In order to keep the conversation alive, you should think about topics such as the weather.<br><br>One: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S1.mp3\">Hi Mary.</a>&quot;<br>Two: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S2.mp3\">Oh, hi.</a>&quot;<br>One: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S3.mp3\">How are you doing?</a>&quot;<br>Two: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S4.mp3\">I&apos;m doing alright. &#xA0;How about you?</a>&quot;<br>One: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S5.mp3\">Not too bad. &#xA0;The weather is great isn&apos;t it?</a>&quot;<br>Two: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S6.mp3\">Yes. &#xA0;It&apos;s absolutely beautiful today.</a>&quot;<br>One: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S7.mp3\">I wish it was like this more frequently.</a>&quot;<br>Two: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S8.mp3\">Me too.</a>&quot;<br>One: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S9.mp3\">So where are you going now?</a>&quot;<br>Two: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S10.mp3\">I&apos;m going to meet a friend of mine at the department store.</a>&quot;<br>One: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S11.mp3\">Going to do a little shopping?</a>&quot;<br>Two: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S12.mp3\">Yeah, I have to buy some presents for my parents.</a>&quot;<br>One: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S13.mp3\">What&apos;s the occasion?</a>&quot;<br>Two: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S14.mp3\">It&apos;s their anniversary.</a>&quot;<br>One: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S15.mp3\">That&apos;s great. &#xA0;Well, you better get going. &#xA0;You don&apos;t want to be late.</a>&quot;<br>Two: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S16.mp3\">I&apos;ll see you next time.</a>&quot;<br>One: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S17.mp3\">Sure. &#xA0;Bye.</a>&quot;<br><br>This example is when you run into someone. &#xA0;This is an easy type of small talk because when you run out of things to say, you can always say bye. &#xA0;There are times when you don&apos;t have that option. &#xA0;Let&apos;s practice a situation where you cannot leave, such as an interview. &#xA0;I go into depth about interview communication in a different section. &#xA0;For now, I am going to emphasize the small talk portion of an interview. &#xA0;There are times when you will not have an opportunity for small talk, but in other cases, you might have to talk about general things.<br><br>Them: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S18.mp3\">Hi. &#xA0;My name is Josh. &#xA0;It&apos;s a pleasure to meet you.</a>&quot;<br>You: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S19.mp3\">Hi Josh. &#xA0;I&apos;m glad to be here.</a>&quot;<br>Them: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S20.mp3\">Did you have any problems finding this place.</a>&quot;<br>You: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S21.mp3\">I didn&apos;t have any problems. &#xA0;I found directions on the internet so it was pretty easy to find. &#xA0;However, the traffic was not that great.</a>&quot;<br>Them: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S22.mp3\">Traffic is never good around here.</a>&quot;<br>You: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S23.mp3\">I agree. &#xA0;It would be great if there was a train or a subway line that went through here.</a>&quot;<br>Them: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S24.mp3\">That would be so great. &#xA0;I would definitely take the train if they had it.</a>&quot;<br>You: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S25.mp3\">Trains are great because you can read a book or get a little rest instead of having to fight the traffic.</a>&quot;<br>Them: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L21/sentence/L21S26.mp3\">Very true. &#xA0;Well, let me begin by telling you about our company...</a>&quot;<br><br>This is a good example of small talk. &#xA0;It shows that you are easy to speak with, and most importantly, you found a small connection even though it was about a small topic such as the traffic problem. &#xA0;In this type of situation, don&apos;t feel that you have to constantly talk. &#xA0;If it is not relevant to the topic, it might be better not to say anything. &#xA0;But if you can add on to the topic, it&apos;s a good thing. &#xA0;The person who is giving the interview has the control, and that person will direct the small talk to the interview when the time is right. &#xA0;In my example above, I made a small transition from the traffic and started the interview process. &#xA0;If you are interested about interview, please go to the Interview Section. &#xA0;You may now move on to the practice session.\r\n"
