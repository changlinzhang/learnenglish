Have to make tuition money right? What did you do?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I took summer school. I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up.&quot;<br>B: &quot;So are you officially a junior now?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Yeah. And I have 5 credits to spare. I only needed to take 10 credits over the summer, but I took 15 because the price was the same.&quot;<br>B: &quot;That makes sense. So where is Nicole?&quot;<br>A: &quot;She dropped out of school completely.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Really? Why?&quot;<br>A: &quot;She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well, they asked her if she wanted to work full time.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Wow. She&apos;s so lucky. She doesn&apos;t have a degree and she already has a job.&quot;<br>A: &quot;It sounds good now, but I&apos;m traditional. I want the degree, so I wouldn&apos;t have accepted the offer.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Do you know how much they are paying her?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I don&apos;t know. But I bet it must have been a good offer, or she wouldn&apos;t have accepted it.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
