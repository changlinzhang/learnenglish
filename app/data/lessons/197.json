    "html": "\r\n<h1>\r\nDating - Preparing Activity after Dinner\r\n</h1>\r\nSometimes a date will end right after dinner. &#xA0;Other times you can go to another place such as a bar, or go bowling, or see a movie. &#xA0;It is your responsibility to find out what the other person likes to do and then suggest it. &#xA0;If the date was strictly for dinner, then it will be difficult, but in this case, Mike suggested a dinner and a movie, or another thing. &#xA0;That means Janet should have left the night open.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L83/sentence/L83S1.mp3\">Have you seen Master and Commander yet? &#xA0;I heard it was a good movie.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L83/sentence/L83S2.mp3\">No, I haven&apos;t.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L83/sentence/L83S3.mp3\">There is an 8:30 showing down the street. &#xA0;Would you like to go see it?</a>&quot;<br><br>Mike made sure to look up movie times and locations before the movie. &#xA0;Then when he suggests a movie, he has all the information.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L83/sentence/L83S4.mp3\">What do you like to do when you are not studying?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L83/sentence/L83S5.mp3\">I like to hang out with friends and drink a little and I also like to go bowling sometimes.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L83/sentence/L83S6.mp3\">Do you want to go bowling after dinner? &#xA0;We can have a few drinks while we play. &#xA0;It will be fun.</a>&quot;<br><br>In this scenario, Mike is using both her interests here. &#xA0;In the States, they serve alcohol so drinking and bowling together is a great option.\r\n"
