Coming up with a guest list and sending out invitations would be the next step. &#xA0;Below we will look at possible questions involved with the planning of a birthday party.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S1.mp3\">My birthday this year is on a Monday. &#xA0;Should I have the party on a Saturday instead?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S2.mp3\">Should we have a surprise birthday party?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S3.mp3\">Who do I invite?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S4.mp3\">What&apos;s the best way to send out invitations?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S5.mp3\">Should we have people RSVP? &#xA0;RSVP means &apos;Please respond.&apos; You are asking people to let you know if they are attending beforehand so you can plan ahead.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S6.mp3\">Should we reserve a room for the party?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S7.mp3\">Where should we get a cake?</a>&quot;<br><br>If you are asked any of these questions, here are ways that you could respond.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S8.mp3\">I would have the party on Saturday then more people might be able to come.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S9.mp3\">It does not really matter, have it whenever you like.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S10.mp3\">He does not like surprises so I would just do a regular party.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S11.mp3\">A surprise party would be fun, just make sure he does not find out.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S12.mp3\">I would just invite family since it&apos;s a small party.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S13.mp3\">You could invite friends and family. &#xA0;Make it a big party this year.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S14.mp3\">You could just pass out invites when you see the people.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S15.mp3\">I would mail them since it is a surprise party.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S16.mp3\">I would have people RSVP so you will know how many people are coming.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S17.mp3\">Having people RSVP lets you plan the party easier.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S18.mp3\">I would reserve a room so no one else is using it.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S19.mp3\">They require a reservation so they can plan ahead for your party.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S20.mp3\">We should get a cake at the bakery.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P235/sentence/P235S21.mp3\">We should get an ice cream cake from the ice cream store.</a>&quot;<br>\r\n"
