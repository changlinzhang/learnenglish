Do they even make the non wireless anymore?</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P219/sentence/P219S12.mp3\">I would make sure you buy a phone that allows you to check your messages while away. &#xA0;That way you can get back to someone faster.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P219/sentence/P219S13.mp3\">I never use that feature. &#xA0;If someone wants to reach me that bad they can just call my cell.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P219/sentence/P219S14.mp3\">You can forward a call to your home to your cell. &#xA0;Just make sure the home phone you buy will allow you to do it.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P219/sentence/P219S15.mp3\">I tried that before and it&apos;s too complicated.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P219/sentence/P219S16.mp3\">Video home phones are great. &#xA0;I use mine to talk to my family in California. It&apos;s nice to be able to see them as you talk.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P219/sentence/P219S17.mp3\">I don&apos;t use video home phones. &#xA0;I just use my computer to video chat.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P219/sentence/P219S18.mp3\">Conference calling is great to use for work but not really practical for the home.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P219/sentence/P219S19.mp3\">I never use conference calling at home, we just use three way calling.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P219/sentence/P219S20.mp3\">Caller ID let&apos;s you know who is calling you. &#xA0;That way you can screen your calls.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P219/sentence/P219S21.mp3\">I use caller ID so I don&apos;t have to talk to all the telemarketers.</a>&quot;<br>\r\n"
