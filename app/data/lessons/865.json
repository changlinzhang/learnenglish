So, what do you like to do on your free time?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I like sports, watching movies, reading books. Things like that.&quot;<br>A: &quot;What type of movies do you like?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I like drama and comedy.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Me too. Mostly drama though. Have you seen Pay it forward?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Yeah. I loved that movie.&quot;<br>A: &quot;It&apos;s one of my favorites. I cried so much at the end.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I thought the idea of paying it forward was awesome.&quot;<br>A: &quot;What was your favorite comedy?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Do you remember the Three Amigos?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Vaguely. I was pretty little when that came out.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I don&apos;t remember it much back then, but I saw it again the other day and it cracked me up.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Maybe I need to see that movie again.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I think it is a classic. So many funny scenes.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I really liked the Mask with Jim Carrey.&quot;<br>B: &quot;He is hilarious. I love that guy.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I like most of his movies. He is such a character.&quot;<br>B: &quot;What else do you like to do?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Well, I like to exercise.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Where do you exercise?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I go to a health club by my house. But on a nice day, I like to jog around the lake.&quot;<br>B: &quot;That&apos;s good. I like to stay in shape too. But I do that by playing a lot of sports. Do you play any sports?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I played a little bit in high school, but nothing really these days.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Have you tried golf?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Don&apos;t start with that. My dad always nagged at me to play, but I never got into it.&quot;<br>B: &quot;What do you usually do with your friends?&quot;<br>A: &quot;We go out shopping a lot.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Where do you usually go?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Usually downtown. It&apos;s more fun in the city than in the mall. Plus, there are too many high school students at the mall.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I know some girls like bags, and some like shoes, what do you like to shop for the most?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I can never have too many pairs of shoes. I have like 30 pairs already, but I am always shopping for more.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Oh. The foods here.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Great. I&apos;m so hungry.&quot;<br>B: &quot;After dinner, do you want to catch a movie?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Sure. I&apos;m always up for a good movie.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
