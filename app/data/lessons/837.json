Is it still available?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Yes it is. Do you know where we&apos;re located?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Yeah. I drove by this morning and I liked the location. What&apos;s the rent?&quot;<br>B: &quot;It&apos;s $850 a month. So you would pay $425 a month plus half of the bills.&quot;<br>A: &quot;How big is the place?&quot;<br>B: &quot;It&apos;s a two bedroom, one bath and roughly about 800 square feet.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Is the complex pretty quiet? Can you hear a lot of noise or anything like that?&quot;<br>B: &quot;They have a strict policy in the apartment complex concerning noise level. So it stays very quiet after 10 PM.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Are you the only person who lives there now?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Yeah. I&apos;m only looking for one roommate.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Everything sounds good. Can we schedule a time to meet so I can look at the place?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I&apos;m available anytime today or tomorrow.&quot;<br>A: &quot;How about if I come over now?&quot;<br>B: &quot;That works with me. But what is your name?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Oh, my name is Brad.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Ok. I&apos;m Randy. So I&apos;ll see you in a bit?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Should only take about 15 minutes to get there.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Sounds good.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
