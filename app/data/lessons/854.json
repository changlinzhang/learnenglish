I heard you are seeing someone.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Yeah. His name is John. I started dating him a week ago.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That&apos;s so exciting. Tell me all about him. Is he good looking?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I think he&apos;s cute, but not drop dead gorgeous.&quot;<br>A: &quot;How did you meet him?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I go to this coffee shop a lot and this guy is always there. We started talking a couple of times, and he finally asked me out.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That&apos;s so cool. What does he do for a living?&quot;<br>B: &quot;He works in the finance department in a manufacturing company.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Do you know if he makes a lot of money?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I don&apos;t know for sure, but he drives a nice car and I heard he has a house.&quot;<br>A: &quot;How is his personality?&quot;<br>B: &quot;He&apos;s very smart and a great person to talk to. In the beginning, we talked for about 30 minutes a day in the coffee shop before he asked me out. Besides that, he&apos;s very sweet and romantic.&quot;<br>A: &quot;How old is he?&quot;<br>B: &quot;That&apos;s the problem. He is 2 years younger than me. What do you think about that?&quot;<br>A: &quot;What&apos;s the big deal? I don&apos;t see anything wrong with that. If you were 23, then I might be worried he was immature, but you&apos;re almost 30 now. 2 years is no big deal.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Yeah. That&apos;s what I think.&quot;<br>A: &quot;When do I get to meet him?&quot;<br>B: &quot;How about a double date. The four of us can go out to dinner and a drink or something.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That sounds great. How about next Saturday?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I think Saturday will be good. Let&apos;s double check with the guys and get back to each other.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Great. I&apos;ll call you later then.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Ok. Talk to you later.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
