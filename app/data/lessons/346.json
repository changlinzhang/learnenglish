Check ups are an important part of keeping a healthy mouth as well as a way of catching any possible problems before they cause any pain or discomfort. &#xA0;<br><br>Here are some questions commonly used when asking about checkups.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P229/sentence/P229S1.mp3\">How often should I go in for checkups?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P229/sentence/P229S2.mp3\">Do they clean your teeth at checkups?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P229/sentence/P229S3.mp3\">Will they take x rays at my check up?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P229/sentence/P229S4.mp3\">Can I ask questions if I have any concerns?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P229/sentence/P229S5.mp3\">Do I really need checkups?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P229/sentence/P229S6.mp3\">Will I have to get any fillings?</a>&quot;<br><br>If you are asked any of these questions, here are ways that you could respond.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P229/sentence/P229S7.mp3\">Normally you should go in for a checkup every six months.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P229/sentence/P229S8.mp3\">I would ask your dentist and see what they recommend for you.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P229/sentence/P229S9.mp3\">My dentist cleans my teeth at my check ups.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P229/sentence/P229S10.mp3\">Usually they do. &#xA0;It feels good when they are done.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P229/sentence/P229S11.mp3\">Sometimes they take x-rays to check your teeth.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P229/sentence/P229S12.mp3\">I think they only take x-rays if they have not seen you before.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P229/sentence/P229S13.mp3\">Yes, this is a time to ask questions if you have them.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P229/sentence/P229S14.mp3\">Ask all the questions you want. &#xA0;They will try and help you.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P229/sentence/P229S15.mp3\">Check ups help keep your mouth clean and healthy.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P229/sentence/P229S16.mp3\">Check ups are a good way to find any problems before they begin to hurt.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P229/sentence/P229S17.mp3\">If you have any cavities then you will have to get a filling.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P229/sentence/P229S18.mp3\">Fillings are not normally part of a check up.</a>&quot;<br>\r\n"
