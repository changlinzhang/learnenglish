You barely know her.&quot;<br>B: &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter. I like everything about her. I like the way she talks, the way she walks, her hair and her lips. I would give anything to kiss her.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Did you tell her how you feel?&quot;<br>B: &quot;No way. I&apos;ll scare her away.&quot;<br>A: &quot;You won&apos;t know until you tell her.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Maybe later. But right now, all I can think about is her legs and her face. She is so beautiful.&quot;<br>A: &quot;You&apos;re wasting your time. At least talk to her. You don&apos;t have to tell her how you feel.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Yeah. I started talking to her in my Poly Sci class. I try to sit next to her as much as I can.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That&apos;s a start.

You&apos;re just infatuated with her.&quot;<br>B: &quot;These feelings are too strong to be infatuation.&quot;<br>A: &quot;We&apos;ll see in a couple of weeks. Let&apos;s go grab something to eat.
