When did you decide this?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I always knew she was the one, but I decided to pop the big question about 2 weeks ago. I&apos;m just debating on how to do it.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That&apos;s exciting man.&quot;<br>B: &quot;So how did you propose?&quot;<br>A: &quot;You shouldn&apos;t use my example. It wasn&apos;t special. I kind of wish I made it more special but it&apos;s too late now.&quot;<br>B: &quot;What do you think I should do?&quot;<br>A: &quot;There are a lot of options. You can surprise her over dinner, or ask her in a public area, or if you have the balls, ask her father in front of her.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I never thought about that.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Thought about what?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Asking her father in front of her. How do you think she will react?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I don&apos;t know. You should know how she&apos;s going to react. She is your girlfriend.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I think that&apos;s the idea I was looking for. Thanks man.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Don&apos;t mention it. Good luck. You&apos;re going to need it.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
