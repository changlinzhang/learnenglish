What are you doing this Friday?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I&apos;m going to go to the driving range cause I&apos;m playing golf on Saturday.&quot;<br>A: &quot;You&apos;re golfing without me? What&apos;s up with that?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Sorry man, but we already have a foursome. I&apos;m going with a couple of guys from work.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Where are you playing?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Washington National. Have you been there yet?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I&apos;ve been there a couple of times. It&apos;s a great course. You know the Huskies play there right?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I didn&apos;t know that. Is it a hard course?&quot;<br>A: &quot;It&apos;s pretty challenging. But it all depends on which tee you play from.&quot;<br>B: &quot;What are you shooting these days?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I&apos;m still hovering around a bogey game.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Still better than me. I&apos;m still trying to hit a bogey game. Do you want to hit the driving range with me?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I can&apos;t this Friday. I&apos;m playing basketball with the guys that night.&quot;<br>B: &quot;At night?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Yeah. We&apos;re playing indoors at a school gymnasium.&quot;<br>B: &quot;What&apos;s the occasion?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Just a small league I play on. Nothing special.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I&apos;m too short to play basketball.&quot;<br>A: &quot;You&apos;re not that short. Plus, we have a couple of guys who are the same height as you. They&apos;re awesome players.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I never got into basketball. It&apos;s fun and all, but maybe I&apos;m just not good at it.&quot;<br>A: &quot;It&apos;s still great exercise. I get a better workout from basketball than I do from the treadmill.&quot;<br>B: &quot;That&apos;s true.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
