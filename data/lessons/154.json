    "html": "\r\n<h1>\r\nExaminations - General Information\r\n</h1>\r\nThe hardest types of questions to answer are the, &apos;What was it like&apos; types, and the &apos;how was&apos; types. &#xA0;The reason it is hard is because you have to explain in your own words the answer. &#xA0;It&apos;s not as simple as a number or a &apos;yes&apos; or &apos;no.&apos;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S1.mp3\">How much percentage is the mid-term towards the final grade?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S2.mp3\">The instructor said it was twenty percent of our final grade.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S3.mp3\">Do you have to write any papers in that class?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S4.mp3\">No. &#xA0;We only had one mid-term and one final.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S5.mp3\">Yes. &#xA0;We had to write 2 essays for that class.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S6.mp3\">How many pages did you have to write for your essays?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S7.mp3\">We had to write 5 pages for both essays.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S8.mp3\">Was the open-book exam hard?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S9.mp3\">Most of the time, open-book exams are harder, but this one was really easy. &#xA0;All the questions were in the glossary so I found the answers quickly.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S10.mp3\">How difficult was the take-home final?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L50/sentence/L50S11.mp3\">It is easy that we have the material to look through, but it is very time consuming. &#xA0;I had to do an all-nighter just to finish.</a>&quot;<br><br>All-nighter means to stay up all night.\r\n"
