    "html": "\r\n<h1>\r\nOffice and Cubicles\r\n</h1>\r\nThe office has three types of workstation setting. &#xA0;Some companies provide a single office for each employee, other companies have a cubicle system, and some companies have desks put together in a large open space where everyone sits. &#xA0;I&apos;ll separate this lesson into these three categories.<br><br><b>Desks all together</b><br><br>If you are in an environment where you have to sit at a desk right next to 15 other people with the same desks, I&apos;m sorry for your situation. &#xA0;It&apos;s very uncomfortable working like this, but it is a reality. &#xA0;Here are some things I heard from people in this setting.<br><br>General statements or complaints<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S1.mp3\">It&apos;s not that bad, but there is no privacy.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S2.mp3\">I wouldn&apos;t mind it so much if the manager couldn&apos;t see every minute of my day.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S3.mp3\">I hate it. &#xA0;Even if they can&apos;t give us offices, they could at least give us cubicles.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S4.mp3\">The reason I hate it so much is because I can&apos;t take a small break. &#xA0;Since the manager is always looking at everyone, even when I am not working, I have to pretend like I am.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S5.mp3\">There are a lot of distractions. &#xA0;I can hear everything everyone says in the whole office.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S6.mp3\">Mary sometimes turns on the music. &#xA0;It&apos;s not that bad, but sometimes I want it quiet.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S7.mp3\">If I have a complaint about something, I can&apos;t talk to the manager because everyone will hear. &#xA0;I have to set up a meeting and use the conference room.</a>&quot;<br><br><b>Questions and Requests</b><br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S8.mp3\">I don&apos;t have another outlet near my desk. &#xA0;Can I get a power strip?</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S9.mp3\">Can I move to a different location? &#xA0;The sun always glares off my monitor and I have trouble working.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S10.mp3\">Can I sit on the other side of the room? &#xA0;This is too close to the door and it gets cold here.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B59/sentence/B59S11.mp3\">I get hot easily. &#xA0;Would it be possible if I sit next to the door? &#xA0;It is much cooler there.</a>&quot;\r\n"
