My name is Robert.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I&apos;m John. It&apos;s nice to meet you.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Do you know what this professor is like?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I have no idea. This is my first year.&quot;<br>A: &quot;You a freshman? Me too. Where are you from?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I&apos;m from San Francisco.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I&apos;ve been there a few times. It&apos;s a great city.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Where are you from?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I grew up in this area all my life.&quot;<br>B: &quot;So you know where all the fun places to hang out right?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Yeah. The best place is over by the water. They have a lot of clubs and bars.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I drove by that area before. I didn&apos;t know it was a college hang-out.&quot;<br>A: &quot;It gets pretty wild over there sometimes. You should go.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Sounds like a good idea. Do you know what you are majoring in yet?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Not yet. I&apos;m leaning towards business, but that&apos;s only if I can&apos;t get into computer science. How about you?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I want to go to med school, so I&apos;ll probably end up majoring in biology.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That&apos;s cool.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Is the weather this bad all the time in the fall?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Yap. This is a typical autumn. It gets worse though. At least it&apos;s not raining that much.&quot;<br>B: &quot;That sucks.&quot;<br>A: &quot;You&apos;ll get used to it. In the meantime, you&apos;ll have to watch a lot of movies. Seems like the only thing to do with the bad weather.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Too expensive. Can you believe how much movies cost these days?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Yeah. It&apos;s crazy. It&apos;s like 9 bucks a movie. I remember when it was half that.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Unless it&apos;s a date, I&apos;m not going to pay that much to watch a movie.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That makes sense.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Oh. The professor is coming. I&apos;ll talk to you later.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Aright.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
