I read up on this company thoroughly and even spoke with a friend who works here. &#xA0;I didn&apos;t hear anything negative about ABC Company. &#xA0;Is there something I should know before working here?</a>&quot;<br><br>The last sentence in the answer is a question you should say with a slight smile. &#xA0;That should lighten the tension a little and show that you are fully confident.\r\n"
