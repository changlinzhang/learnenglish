    "html": "\r\n<h1>\r\nMovie Discussion - General Statements\r\n</h1>\r\nIn this movie section, we are going to have discussions about movies that we already saw. &#xA0;This is useful because whenever we come out of a movie theatre, we always ask our friends what we thought about the movie. &#xA0;Sometimes, it&apos;s a simple answer such as, &apos;It was alright.&apos; &#xA0;But sometimes, a good discussion can arise from a great movie. &#xA0;Let&apos;s get started...<br><br>Every time I finish watching a movie, I either ask someone, or someone asks me, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L27/sentence/L27S1.mp3\">What did you think about the movie?</a>&quot; &#xA0;For the most part, the answer is a simple one line sentence:<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L27/sentence/L27S2.mp3\">It was alright.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L27/sentence/L27S3.mp3\">It could have been better.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L27/sentence/L27S4.mp3\">It was pretty good.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L27/sentence/L27S5.mp3\">I liked it.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L27/sentence/L27S6.mp3\">It was entertaining.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L27/sentence/L27S7.mp3\">It was so stupid I almost fell asleep.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L27/sentence/L27S8.mp3\">Lame</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L27/sentence/L27S9.mp3\">Boring</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L27/sentence/L27S10.mp3\">Too unrealistic</a>&quot;<br><br>I can go on for a long time describing movies. &#xA0;I have listed a few so you get an idea how to answer simple movie questions.<br><br>Besides simple one line answers, there are a few reasons we need to say other things. &#xA0;It is because either we didn&apos;t understand something, want to describe a scene we liked, want to describe a scene that was stupid, or simply go on and on about how great the movie was.\r\n"
