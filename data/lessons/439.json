    "html": "\r\n<h1>\r\nCubicles\r\n</h1>\r\nA cubicle is a work area that is separated by small portable walls. &#xA0;It is generally about 4 to 5 feet high and it gives a little more privacy. &#xA0;Although it&apos;s not as good as an office, it is much better than having to sit in an open area looking at everyone. &#xA0;Another benefit of having a cubicle is that you can personalize the space. &#xA0;There are small walls to put up pictures, decoration, or to put up a white board or a cork board.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B60/sentence/B60S1.mp3\">I sit in the cubicle down the hall. &#xA0;It&apos;s next to the conference room.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B60/sentence/B60S2.mp3\">My cubicle is directly on the other side of this wall. &#xA0;Come by sometime.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B60/sentence/B60S3.mp3\">The files are on my desk in my cubicle. &#xA0;I&apos;ll get them for you.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B60/sentence/B60S4.mp3\">I walked by your cubicle and saw a heater. &#xA0;Where did you get such a small one like that? &#xA0;I think I want one for my cubicle as well.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B60/sentence/B60S5.mp3\">There are a couple of people with the name Steve in our office. &#xA0;If you say, &apos;Steve&apos; real loud, you will see two heads appear at the same time. &#xA0;It&apos;s quite funny.</a>&quot;<br><br>If you hear the term &apos;cube farm&apos;, it is referring to a huge space with a lot of cubicles.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B60/sentence/B60S6.mp3\">I heard ABC Company has a serious cube farm. &#xA0;Even the CEO has a cubicle. &#xA0;I think that&apos;s pretty cool.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B60/sentence/B60S7.mp3\">How big is your cubicle?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B60/sentence/B60S8.mp3\">My cubicle is about 5 feet by 6 feet.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B60/sentence/B60S9.mp3\">It&apos;s roughly 5 by 6.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B60/sentence/B60S10.mp3\">I&apos;m not sure, but it fits two small desks and a drawer. &#xA0;I guess it&apos;s big enough for me.</a>&quot;\r\n"
