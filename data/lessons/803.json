I tried to get in last semester, but it was full by the time I registered.&quot;<br>A: &quot;What other classes are you going to take?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I still need to take English 201, but I really don&apos;t like writing.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I took that class already. There is a lot of writing, but it&apos;s not that bad.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Oh really? Who was the instructor? There are like 4 different instructors to choose from.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I had Professor Mahoney.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Is he an easy grader?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I&apos;m not sure if he is or not, but I thought he was definitely fair.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Do you mind if I ask you what you got?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Not at all. I got a 3.8.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Well, what did you get in English 101 last year?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I got a 4.0 in that class.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Well, I can&apos;t compare to you. I got a 3.1 in English 101. That means if you got a lower grade in English 201, it must be harder.&quot;<br>A: &quot;It&apos;s not what it appears. I actually tried harder in the 101 class. If I put as much effort into the 201 class, I would have received the same grade.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Oh. That helps. Thanks.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
