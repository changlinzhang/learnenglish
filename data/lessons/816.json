Did you play when you were a kid?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Yeah. I played until I graduated from high school.&quot;<br>A: &quot;What position did you play?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I think I tried every position, but the last few years, I played third.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I hate third base. It&apos;s scary when the ball is coming at you so fast.&quot;<br>B: &quot;It was scary at first, but after awhile, I got used to it. If you have fast reflexes, then it&apos;s not really a problem. What position did you play?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I played outfield. I hated the infield because I never figured out all the bounces.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I wish I could play again, but there isn&apos;t much opportunities around here.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I&apos;m on a softball league. It&apos;s not fast pitch, but it&apos;s still fun. You wanna join our group?&quot;<br>B: &quot;When do you guys play?&quot;<br>A: &quot;We play either Tuesdays or Thursdays.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Sounds pretty fun.
