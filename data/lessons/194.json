    "html": "\r\n<h1>\r\nDating Part - Asking for a Date\r\n</h1>\r\nIn the previous section, we covered talking to someone before getting a date. &#xA0;In the next section we are going to work on some sentences you need to say during the date.<br><br>As I said previously, there isn&apos;t really another dating language. &#xA0;Most of it is regular conversation such as small talk, movies, hobbies, school, and work topics.<br><br>Let&apos;s start where we left off. &#xA0;By now, you should have a phone number. &#xA0;It is your responsibility to call and get a date. &#xA0;Even though you got a phone number doesn&apos;t guarantee a date. &#xA0;You have to convince the person to actually show up. &#xA0;Here is what you should say.<br><br><b>On the phone</b><br><br>Them: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S1.mp3\">Hello</a>&quot;<br>You: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S2.mp3\">Hi. &#xA0;Is Janet there?</a>&quot;<br>Them: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S3.mp3\">This is Janet.</a>&quot;<br>You: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S4.mp3\">Hi Janet. &#xA0;This is Mike. &#xA0;I met you at the party last Saturday night.</a>&quot;<br>Them: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S5.mp3\">Oh. &#xA0;Hi Mike.</a>&quot;<br>You: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S6.mp3\">Did you enjoy the party?</a>&quot;<br>Them: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S7.mp3\">I had a great time. &#xA0;How about you?</a>&quot;<br>You: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S8.mp3\">The next morning was tough, but it was real fun, especially meeting you.</a>&quot;<br>Them: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S9.mp3\">It was great meeting you too.</a>&quot;<br>You: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S10.mp3\">Can I take you out to dinner followed by a movie or some other thing?</a>&quot;<br>Them: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S11.mp3\">Well, I am a little busy with school and all.</a>&quot;<br>You: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S12.mp3\">A couple hours shouldn&apos;t hurt too much. &#xA0;I&apos;ll make sure you have a good time. &#xA0;If you want, we can talk about your school. &#xA0;Maybe I can help you on some topics you are unsure about.</a>&quot;<br>Them: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S13.mp3\">Ok. &#xA0;Sounds good. &#xA0;I&apos;m free this Friday after 6:00. &#xA0;How does that sound to you?</a>&quot;<br>You: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S14.mp3\">That sounds good. &#xA0;Do you want to meet somewhere or would you like for me to pick you up?</a>&quot;<br>Them: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S15.mp3\">If you don&apos;t mind Italian, I&apos;ll meet you at Olive Garden at 6:30 on Friday.</a>&quot;<br>You: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L80/sentence/L80S16.mp3\">Sounds great. &#xA0;I&apos;ll see you then.</a>&quot;<br><br>Let&apos;s analyze this small conversation real quick. &#xA0;First, Mike didn&apos;t assume that Janet remembered him. &#xA0;He reminded Janet where and when they met. &#xA0;It isn&apos;t a good idea to put someone on the spot right.<br><br>Next, Mike asked if Janet had a good time. &#xA0;This is a small talk question to break the ice.<br><br>Afterwards, Mike gave a small compliment by saying, &apos;... it was real fun, especially meeting you.&apos;<br><br>So Mike is giving an indication that he is interested in Janet.<br><br>Next, Mike asks for dinner.<br><br>Janet&apos;s response is important to learn from. &#xA0;She knows Mike has interest in her, but she is not too sure. &#xA0;When Mike asks for dinner, she is hesitant. &#xA0;We see this when she says, &apos;I am a little busy with school and all.&apos;<br><br>Everyone is busy, and Mike knows that this is an excuse of not going out. &#xA0;There are many things that Mike can do now.<br><br>1. &#xA0;&#xA0;Mike can put pressure on her without any substance like, &apos;Come on. &#xA0;Let&apos;s just go out.&apos; Or he can not even let her completely answer by saying, &apos;I&apos;ll meet you at Olive Garden at 7:00.&apos;<br>2. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Mike can be a coward and say, &apos;Ok. &#xA0;Well, if you decide to change your mind, give me a call.&apos;<br>3. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Or Mike can persuade Janet by appealing to her interests.<br><br>The number 1 choice doesn&apos;t work because putting pressure on someone is not good. &#xA0;She might not come, or start with a bad impression. &#xA0;Number 2 choice will result in Janet never calling back.<br><br>The answer Mike gave is a great answer. &#xA0;He is promising that she will have a good time, and also understanding her school interest and promising to talk about her school.<br><br>From Janet&apos;s perspective, Mike has good manners not pressuring too much, and understanding her interest by talking about her schooling.\r\n"
