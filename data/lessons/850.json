How come?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I like to keep up with the Lakers.&quot;<br>B: &quot;You keep up with baseball at all?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Just a little. Not as much as basketball.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Who is your favorite player?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Probably Kobe Bryant, but he has too many issues right now.&quot;<br>B: &quot;He&apos;s a great player, but his recent problem is really affecting his play.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Hope everything turns out ok. Do you play basketball much?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I usually get into it during the playoffs. I&apos;d rather play than watch.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I like to watch as much as I like to play. Do you play often?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Every now and then with some friends.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I usually play twice a week at the health club. It&apos;s easy to round up 10 guys during the evening time.&quot;<br>B: &quot;That sounds pretty fun. But I&apos;m too out of shape to play full court.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I get tired too, but I figure it&apos;s good for my health. And I&apos;m having fun at the same time.&quot;<br>B: &quot;So you think the Lakers will do good this year?&quot;<br>A: &quot;They better. They got a lot of good players now. If Malone can stay healthy, then I don&apos;t see how they can be beat.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I don&apos;t know... I think Sacramento has a strong team this year.&quot;<br>A: &quot;True, but I&apos;m pulling for the Lakers all the way. It&apos;s going to be a great season.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
