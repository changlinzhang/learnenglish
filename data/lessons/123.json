After becoming comfortable with the entire conversation, become Person A by clicking on the Person A button. You will hear only Person B through the audio file. There will be a silence for you to repeat the sentences of Person A. Do the same for Person B. The speed of the conversation is native speed. Use the pause button if the pause between each sentence is too fast for you. After practicing several times, you will be able to speak as fast as a native.<table border=\"0\"><tr><td>1 &#xA0;</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L26/practice/L26P1.mp3\">Listen All</a>&#xA0;&#xA0;|&#xA0;&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L26/practice/L26P1b.mp3\">Person A</a>&#xA0;&#xA0;|&#xA0;&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L26/practice/L26P1a.mp3\">Person B</a></td></tr><tr><td>A: &quot;What type of movies do you like?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I like comedies.

How about western movies?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Western and horror are the two types of movies I don&apos;t care for.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Why don&apos;t you like horror? They&apos;re entertaining.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Some are entertaining, but I find most of them stupid and childish. For example, I don&apos;t understand why a person always goes into the house alone when something is suspicious.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Ha ha. I know what you mean. But it&apos;s just a movie. They need for the characters to do that.&quot;<br><br></td></tr><tr><td>3 &#xA0;</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L26/practice/L26P3.mp3\">Listen All</a>&#xA0;&#xA0;|&#xA0;&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L26/practice/L26P3b.mp3\">Person A</a>&#xA0;&#xA0;|&#xA0;&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L26/practice/L26P3a.mp3\">Person B</a></td></tr><tr><td>A: &quot;Hey, you wanna see a movie tomorrow?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Sounds like a good plan.
