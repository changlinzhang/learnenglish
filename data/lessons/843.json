Cancun is supposed to be a great place.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That sounds pretty good. But how about the Caribbean?&quot;<br>B: &quot;That doesn&apos;t sound too bad either. Do you know how much it would cost for airfare and hotel?&quot;<br>A: &quot;If we go for 5 nights, then the total for airfare and hotel would be about one thousand seven hundred dollars. How much would it be to go to Cancun?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I found a deal for only twelve hundred dollars.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That&apos;s a lot cheaper. Let&apos;s go to Cancun then.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Really? That sounds great. I picked up a lot of brochures. Let&apos;s take a look at all the things we can do.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That reminds me. I better make sure my passport is not expired.&quot;<br>B: &quot;You better make sure. If it&apos;s expired, you have to hurry and renew it.&quot;<br>A: &quot;We still have a couple of months. No rush.&quot;<br>B: &quot;What do you want to do in Cancun?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I want to golf at least one day. And I also want to try surfing. Do they have instructors on the beach?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Yeah. This brochure shows lesson and equipment rentals and everything. That shouldn&apos;t be a problem. I want to try snorkeling.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Do we need to buy snorkeling gear?&quot;<br>B: &quot;No. We can just rent it there.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Sounds like we&apos;re going to have fun.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I know. I can&apos;t wait. It&apos;s going to be so fun.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
