    "html": "\r\n<h1>\r\nMovie Discussion - Example Dialog\r\n</h1>\r\nAs of this writing, the latest movie I saw was The Last Samurai. &#xA0;After the movie, I had a meal with a couple of people. &#xA0;We had a good discussion due to this movie. &#xA0;It is difficult to specifically teach what you will need to know about movie conversations because every movie will require different words and sentences. &#xA0;The only thing I can do here is to give ideas and couple of examples about movie conversations. &#xA0;So this is not really going to be a practice section, but a chance to hear a real conversation from a movie. &#xA0;You can click on each individual sentence, or you can click on the link provided below to hear a real life conversation.<br><br><b><i><a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S1.mp3\">Listen to the conversation</a></i></b><br><br>A: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S2.mp3\">Did you like the movie?</a>&quot;<br>B: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S3.mp3\">It was better than I thought.</a>&quot;<br>C: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S4.mp3\">I liked it.</a>&quot;<br>A: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S5.mp3\">The movie didn&apos;t have many cheesy or stupid scenes.</a>&quot;<br>B: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S6.mp3\">Yeah. &#xA0;I&apos;m glad that they didn&apos;t have any love scenes. &#xA0;Sometimes a love scene destroys a good movie.</a>&quot;<br>C: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S7.mp3\">I thought the scene where the girl was washing her hair and Tom Cruise came to say good bye was stupid. &#xA0;Why did they have that there? &#xA0;It didn&apos;t make sense.</a>&quot;<br>B: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S8.mp3\">I agree. &#xA0;They didn&apos;t need that scene.</a>&quot;<br>A: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S9.mp3\">I don&apos;t see the harm in that scene. &#xA0;They didn&apos;t do anything or show anything. &#xA0;What&apos;s the big deal?</a>&quot;<br>C: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S10.mp3\">When you are talking about good movies versus great movies, each and every scene counts.</a>&quot;<br>A: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S11.mp3\">That&apos;s true.</a>&quot;<br>B: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S12.mp3\">But besides those one or two scenes, the movie was great.</a>&quot;<br>A: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S13.mp3\">I liked everything about it. &#xA0;I really liked the samurai that was beating up Cruise in the beginning of the movie. &#xA0;The guy second in command. &#xA0;He was cool too.</a>&quot;<br>B: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S14.mp3\">Every movie has a guy like him. &#xA0;They try to make him awesome even though they don&apos;t say much.</a>&quot;<br>C: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S15.mp3\">I don&apos;t understand why Tom Cruise went back to that village. &#xA0;If he was the only survivor, wouldn&apos;t that make everyone suspicious about where his loyalty lies?</a>&quot;<br>A: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S16.mp3\">It was clear in the movie that he loved the place and the samurais. &#xA0;Clearly everyone knows that he isn&apos;t a traitor. &#xA0;I would have done the same thing in his position.</a>&quot;<br>B: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S17.mp3\">I think so too.</a>&quot;<br>C: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S18.mp3\">But isn&apos;t it suspicious that he is the only survivor.</a>&quot;<br>A: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S19.mp3\">Well, all the samurais were looking for a death in battle. &#xA0;Cruise wasn&apos;t.</a>&quot;<br>C: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S20.mp3\">But only the boss received the satisfaction of being killed with the sword. &#xA0;Nobody else did.</a>&quot;<br>A: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S21.mp3\">True.</a>&quot;<br>B: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S22.mp3\">What are we going to order?</a>&quot;<br>C: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S23.mp3\">I am going to have a chicken burger because of the Mad Cow disease.</a>&quot;<br>A: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S24.mp3\">Me too.</a>&quot;<br>B: &#xA0;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L29/sentence/L29S25.mp3\">I&apos;m just having a soup and salad.</a>&quot;\r\n"
