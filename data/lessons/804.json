I forgot about registration. I&apos;m a day late, so all the classes are mostly full. What do you think I should do?&quot;<br>B: &quot;You&apos;re screwed. You can&apos;t do anything about that. You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Do you think going to the registration building will help at all.&quot;<br>B: &quot;No. They will tell you the same thing in a worse way.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Did you register yet?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Of course. Registering for classes is not something you want to miss.&quot;<br>A: &quot;What classes do you think are still open?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Well, I know psychology 101 is a big class, so there will always be seats in that class. You can also get into Sociology.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That&apos;s helpful. Thanks. But what do you think about philosophy. I wanted to take that class this semester.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I took that class last year. The professor is really cool, so if you go to his office, you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full.&quot;<br>A: &quot;He does that?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I guess that&apos;s because so many people drop out of that class.&quot;<br>A: &quot;That makes sense. I think I&apos;ll do that. Thanks for all the help.&quot;<br>B: &quot;No problem man.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
