    "html": "\r\n<h1>\r\nComplaining about another co-worker to a co-worker\r\n</h1>\r\nI remember in my first job, I had a co-worker I really didn&apos;t like. &#xA0;He was a nice guy, but he was a complete idiot. &#xA0;To vent out my frustration, I talked with some closer co-workers about my problems with him. &#xA0;Here are some of the things I said. &#xA0;You might be in a similar situation of dealing with a complete idiot.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B42/sentence/B42S1.mp3\">Have you worked with Jake yet? &#xA0;He can&apos;t do anything right.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B42/sentence/B42S2.mp3\">The problem with Jake is that he doesn&apos;t know that he is an idiot.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B42/sentence/B42S3.mp3\">I remember helping Jake out so much, and then he stabs my back.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B42/sentence/B42S4.mp3\">I don&apos;t think he does his own work. &#xA0;He goes around asking everyone to do a portion of his work and says he did it all.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B42/sentence/B42S5.mp3\">If you have to work with Jake, remember the things I told you.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B42/sentence/B42S6.mp3\">Is management blind or am I being too sensitive about this?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B42/sentence/B42S7.mp3\">I think the manager likes him because he kisses her ass all day long.</a>&quot;<br><br>Kissing ass refers to butt kiss and brown nosing. &#xA0;Basically, a person who butt kisses is a person always saying good things to the manager, giving compliments, showing off in front of the manager, and doing anything possible to look good.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B42/sentence/B42S8.mp3\">The manager is blind because he is a total brown-noser.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/B42/sentence/B42S9.mp3\">I can&apos;t believe this company is paying $75,000 a year for this fool.</a>&quot;\r\n"
