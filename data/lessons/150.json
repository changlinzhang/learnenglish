    "html": "\r\n<h1>\r\nUniversity Classes - Dropping Out / Withdrawal\r\n</h1>\r\nThere are two ways to leave a class. &#xA0;You either drop out, or you withdraw. &#xA0;Dropping out usually means you are going to get a failing grade and you don&apos;t care about it. &#xA0;But primarily, dropping out refers to leaving college life altogether. &#xA0;So if you intend to say that you dropped out of a class, you should use withdraw. &#xA0;There are several time periods for withdrawal. &#xA0;The first week, there is no penalty. &#xA0;The second week up to the first month, a W will show up on your transcript. &#xA0;And finally, withdrawal after the half way point will give you a failing grade. &#xA0;But this is dependent on each school policy. &#xA0;So learn the withdrawal format of your school. &#xA0;I was using the dates mentioned above only as an example. &#xA0;Let&apos;s learn some sentences to say these kinds of things.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S1.mp3\">I dropped out of my chemistry class.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S2.mp3\">I withdrew from my biology class.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S3.mp3\">I had too many classes as it is, so I dropped out of my statistics class.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S4.mp3\">I couldn&apos;t keep up with the schedule, so I dropped out of that class.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S5.mp3\">I couldn&apos;t understand the material, so I withdrew.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S6.mp3\">I hated the professor, so I just withdrew.</a>&quot;<br><br>If you need to ask questions about withdrawal, these may help:<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S7.mp3\">When is the last day to withdraw?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S8.mp3\">If I withdraw now, will it show up on my transcript?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S9.mp3\">Does a withdrawal look bad on the transcript?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S10.mp3\">How do I drop out of a class that I don&apos;t want to take anymore?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S11.mp3\">What is the procedure to withdraw from class?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S12.mp3\">How do I withdraw from a certain class?</a>&quot;<br><br>Other things you might want to say when discussing this topic...<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S13.mp3\">Are you sure you want to drop out of that class. &#xA0;You only have 4 more weeks. &#xA0;At least you can get the credit.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S14.mp3\">If I stay in that class, I&apos;m going to screw up my GPA.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S15.mp3\">The best I can do is a C in this class. &#xA0;I don&apos;t want a C on my transcript. &#xA0;I&apos;m going to withdraw from the class.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S16.mp3\">If you get a bad grade, can&apos;t you just re-take the course?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L47/sentence/L47S17.mp3\">Even if I retake the course, both grades are used. &#xA0;This school has a different system where re-taking the course doesn&apos;t really help.</a>&quot;\r\n"
