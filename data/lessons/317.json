share foods you love but it is also a good opportunity to talk and learn about one another. &#xA0;In this lesson, we will be covering everything you need to know from coming up with a meal to prepare, cooking it together, and sharing a conversation.<br><br><b>Invitation and Planning</b><br><br>First you must choose a meal to share. &#xA0;Breakfast is eaten in the morning, lunch in the afternoon and dinner in the evening. &#xA0;The steps for planning a menu are relatively the same for all three. &#xA0;When planning a meal it is also important to try and come up with something you all will enjoy. &#xA0;<br><br>Here are some questions commonly used when asking someone to cook a meal and have dinner.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S1.mp3\">Would you like to come over to my house and have dinner with me?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S2.mp3\">Maybe we could cook dinner together?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S3.mp3\">What time should we plan on getting together?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S4.mp3\">Do you have any suggestions on what we could make?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S5.mp3\">We should probably make a grocery list.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S6.mp3\">Do you want to go to the grocery store together?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S7.mp3\">What grocery store do you prefer?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S8.mp3\">If we could go together do you want me to drive?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S9.mp3\">Should we pick up any wine or beer to drink at dinner?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S10.mp3\">Maybe we can split the grocery bill?</a>&quot;<br><br>If you are asked any of these questions, here are ways that you could respond.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S11.mp3\">Sure, I would love to come over for dinner. &#xA0;I really love to cook and it might give us some time to catch up with one another.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S12.mp3\">That sounds great. &#xA0;I am free tonight so I can definitely make it.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S13.mp3\">Cooking dinner together sounds fun.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S14.mp3\">I think that is a good idea, maybe we can share recipes.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S15.mp3\">How does 5 o&apos;clock sound?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S16.mp3\">I get off work at 5. &#xA0;I can go straight home to grab a few things and meet you around 6.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S17.mp3\">I have this new recipe I have been dying to try. &#xA0;Do you like Italian food?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S18.mp3\">I am not too picky. &#xA0;I have some steak and chicken we can use.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S19.mp3\">Yes we probably should make a list. &#xA0;I don&apos;t want to forget anything.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S20.mp3\">I am pretty sure I will remember everything we need, but if you want to jot a few things down that is ok with me.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S21.mp3\">Sure, we can go to the grocery store together.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S22.mp3\">Let&apos;s see what we both have at home to cook and maybe we can skip the grocery.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S23.mp3\">I usually shop at Albertsons.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S24.mp3\">I don&apos;t have a preference where we go.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S25.mp3\">If it&apos;s ok I can just meet you there.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S26.mp3\">Sure, you can drive if you don&apos;t mind.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S27.mp3\">I do not drink alcohol but maybe we could grab some soda.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S28.mp3\">Sure, wine sounds good with dinner. &#xA0;I prefer white wine.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S29.mp3\">I think splitting the bill is a good idea.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P200/sentence/P200S30.mp3\">No big deal. &#xA0;I can buy the groceries this time and if we do this again you can treat.</a>&quot;<br>\r\n"
