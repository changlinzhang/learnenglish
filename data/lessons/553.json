I like the combination of the two. &#xA0;It&apos;s great working in teams while getting and sharing ideas with each other, but it&apos;s also nice to sit at your desk and work hard productively. &#xA0;I like to do both so it&apos;s hard to choose one over the other.</a>&quot;<br><br>If they insist on choosing one, then choose the one that is relevant to the job you are interviewing for. &#xA0;Make sure you pause a little before saying so.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/I103/sentence/I103S3.mp3\">If I had to choose just one, then... I&apos;d probably choose to work alone.</a>&quot;\r\n"
