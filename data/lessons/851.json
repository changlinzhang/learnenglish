Packers are playing the Chiefs.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I never understood this game.&quot;<br>B: &quot;It&apos;s not that hard. If you watch a couple of games, you&apos;ll start to understand it.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Do you watch a lot of football?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I like the Packers, so I watch all their games.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Did you play football before?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Only in high school. I was too small to play for college.&quot;<br>A: &quot;What position did you play?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I was the corner back.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Is that the main guy in offense?&quot;<br>B: &quot;No. That&apos;s the quarterback. The corner back is a defensive player covering passing plays and outside running plays.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I see. Do you think it is more fun than baseball?&quot;<br>B: &quot;It&apos;s hard to compare the two because they&apos;re so different. I like both baseball and football. How about you? You like baseball a lot?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Yeah. I&apos;m a big baseball fan.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Baseball is fun, but you should also learn football. I&apos;ll explain as we watch.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Cool.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
