It was the worst feeling in the world. I was crying everyday for three months. And slowly, it got better. I know you&apos;ll feel better too.&quot;<br>B: &quot;You&apos;ve been through this too?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Yeah. I remember it very clearly. The pain makes it easy to remember. I know you&apos;re really hurting right now, but you know many people experience break ups.&quot;<br>B: &quot;But it hurts too much.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I know it&apos;s painful, but it&apos;s only temporary. After the pain goes away, you&apos;ll find other girls.&quot;<br>B: &quot;What if I don&apos;t want to find another girl?&quot;<br>A: &quot;You&apos;ll change your mind. Look at everyone in the world. They all break up and move on. The faster you understand this, the quicker you will recover.&quot;<br>B: &quot;You&apos;re right.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I also know you must still have strong feelings for her, but try to think of all the bad things. You know she didn&apos;t treat you that well. Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Yeah. Thanks for the talk.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I&apos;ll give you a call later. We should hang out. It&apos;s good to be around people.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Ok. I&apos;ll talk to you later.&quot;<br></div><br><br>You should read the Conversation Dialog to help you study after going through the listening lesson.
