When looking for a pet you may also consider visiting a shelter. &#xA0;Many animals at a shelter need a good home and most likely will already have their vaccines and be spayed or neutered. &#xA0;A shelter is a good place where stray or homeless animals are taken in order to try and find them suitable homes.<br><br>Here are some questions commonly used when discussing what kind of pet to consider.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S1.mp3\">Do you like cats or dogs?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S2.mp3\">Do we have time for training?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S3.mp3\">Do you have a house or an apartment?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S4.mp3\">Is this going to be a family pet?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S5.mp3\">Would you consider getting a pet from a shelter?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S6.mp3\">Is there any other animals you are considering?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S7.mp3\">Are you active?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S8.mp3\">Are you comfortable grooming a cat or dog?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S9.mp3\">What kind of food should you feed it?</a>&quot;<br><br>If you are asked any of these questions, here are ways that you could respond.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S10.mp3\">We like cats and dogs but are looking more for a dog.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S11.mp3\">My wife is allergic to cats, so we prefer a dog.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S12.mp3\">We both work full time so finding time for training may be tough.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S13.mp3\">I really want to be committed so I will take my dog to training classes.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S14.mp3\">We live in a small apartment so maybe a cat or very small dog would be best.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S15.mp3\">We have a house with a yard so we have lots of room for any size dog.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S16.mp3\">Yes, we have children so we need a pet that can get along with small kids.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S17.mp3\">This is just me, so my house is pretty quiet.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S18.mp3\">We are not sure about cats or dogs but we really are interested in a fish.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S19.mp3\">My kids really want a hamster, but my husband and I are not too sure yet.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S20.mp3\">I run everyday so having a dog that could run with me would be great.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S21.mp3\">We go on walks occasionally but are not really active.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S22.mp3\">I am not too comfortable grooming animals so I would probably take it somewhere for nail trims and baths.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S23.mp3\">Yes, I am familiar with brushing and nail cutting but we would have to take it somewhere to get it bathed.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S24.mp3\">I think we should just ask our veterinarian.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/P206/sentence/P206S25.mp3\">I hear that a raw diet is the best. &#xA0;Maybe we can look up information on it.</a>&quot;<br>\r\n"
