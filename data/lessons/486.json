I think my best friend would describe me as honest, detailed, and very organized.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/I36/sentence/I36S3.mp3\">I think my best friend would say that I&apos;m very responsible. &#xA0;Whenever our group of friends had to coordinate an activity, they always relied on me.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/I36/sentence/I36S4.mp3\">My best friend would probably say that I&apos;m warm, friendly, and understanding.</a>&quot;<br><br>It doesn&apos;t have to be long, but don&apos;t blurt out the answer without thinking. &#xA0;Then it makes it appear as you are thinking about it instead of saying an answer you already prepared.\r\n"
