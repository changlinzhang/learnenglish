    "html": "\r\n<h1>\r\nDating - Asking for Second Date\r\n</h1>\r\nAnother way to get another date is by suggesting another restaurant. Janet likes Italian restaurants. But she chose Olive Garden. If the date went well, and you know of another Italian restaurant, you can suggest another date near the end of dinner.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L82/sentence/L82S1.mp3\">Is Italian one of your favorite types of food?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L82/sentence/L82S2.mp3\">Yeah. I like all types of pasta.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L82/sentence/L82S3.mp3\">I know this great little Italian restaurant on the waterfront. It&apos;s small but very authentic. I&apos;d love to take you there next week or something.</a>&quot;<br><br>Or, if you know of another type of restaurant here is what you can say.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L82/sentence/L82S4.mp3\">Have you ever had French food?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L82/sentence/L82S5.mp3\">I&apos;ve had French Fries before.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L82/sentence/L82S6.mp3\">I&apos;m talking about real French food.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L82/sentence/L82S7.mp3\">No. I don&apos;t even know what is considered French food.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L82/sentence/L82S8.mp3\">I&apos;ve been to this great French restaurant a couple of months ago. The food was amazing. I would like to take you there sometime. Would you be interested?</a>&quot;\r\n"
