What types of questions did you get?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Mostly on the civil war. You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr. had on American society.&quot;<br>A: &quot;How about Abraham Lincoln? Did you get any questions about him?&quot;<br>B: &quot;I only had 1 question about him. But you might get more. I don&apos;t know if he will have the same exam or not.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Hopefully he will use the same exam, cause I&apos;m going to spend most of my time studying the civil war. It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class.&quot;<br>B: &quot;If you can&apos;t study everything, then that is probably the best way to go.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Aright.
